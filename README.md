# Bhagavad-Gita
Bhagavad is a 700-verse Hindu scripture, which is part of the epic Mahabharata.


The Bhagavad Gita (IPA: [ˌbʱɐɡɐʋɐd ˈɡiːtɑː], Sanskrit: भगवद्गीता, romanized: bhagavad-gītā, lit. ‘God's Song’), often simply called the Gita (IAST: gītā), is a revered 700-verse scripture that holds a pivotal place within Hinduism, forming a crucial segment of the epic Mahabharata. This sacred text, believed to have been composed in the latter half of the first millennium BCE, transcends the boundaries of Hindu denominations and stands as the most influential and universally acknowledged spiritual treatise within the Hindu tradition. It is often asserted that if any single text encapsulates the essence of Hindu philosophy in its entirety, it is the Bhagavad Gita.

The narrative of the Bhagavad Gita unfolds as a profound dialogue between the valiant Pandava prince Arjuna and his divine charioteer, Krishna, who is an avatar of Vishnu. The discourse takes place on the eve of the Kurukshetra War, a cataclysmic battle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. At this crucial juncture, Arjuna is overwhelmed with anguish at the prospect of the impending slaughter and is paralyzed by the moral dilemma of engaging in a war against his own kin. In this moment of existential crisis, Arjuna contemplates renouncing the battle. Seeking solace and guidance, he turns to Krishna, whose subsequent teachings and philosophical exposition form the core of the Gita.

Krishna's counsel to Arjuna is to fulfill his duty as a Kshatriya (warrior) in the preservation of dharma (righteousness). The Krishna-Arjuna dialogue traverses a vast expanse of spiritual themes, addressing profound moral and ethical quandaries and delving into philosophical inquiries that extend far beyond the immediate context of the battlefield. The battlefield setting itself has been interpreted as a grand allegory for the trials, tribulations, and moral struggles inherent in the human condition.
