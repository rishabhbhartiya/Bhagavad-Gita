It purifies those who hear it.  It is directly realizable, in accordance withdharma, easy to practice, and everlasting in effect.","Rājameans “king.”  Shree Krishna uses the metaphorrājato emphasize the paramount position of the knowledge He is going to reveal.Vidyāmeans “science.”  He does not refer to His teachings as creed, religion, dogma, doctrine, or belief.  He declares that what He is going to describe to Arjun is the king of sciences.Guhyameans “secret.”  This knowledge is also the supreme secret.  Since love is only possible where there is a choice, God deliberately hides Himself from direct perception, thereby providing the soul the freedom to exercise the choice of loving Him or not.  A machine cannot love, for it is devoid of choices.  God wants us to love Him and so He gives us the option to choose Him or not, as we wish.  He merely makes us aware of the consequences of what we choose, either way, and then leaves it to us to decide the path we wish to follow.Pavitrammeans “pure.”  Knowledge of devotion is supremely pure because it is untainted by petty selfishness.  It inspires sacrifice of the self at the altar of divine love for the Supreme Lord.  Bhakti also purifies the devotee by destroyingpāp, bīja,andavidyā.Pāpis the stockpile of past sins of endless lifetimes of the individual soul.  Bhakti burns them up as a fire burns up a bundle of straw.Bījarefers to impurities of the heart, which are the seeds of sinful activities.  If the seeds exist, then destroying the results of past sins will not suffice, for the propensity to sin will remain in the heart and one will sin again.  Bhakti purifies the heart and destroys the seeds of sin, which are lust, anger, and greed.  However, even the destruction of the seeds is not enough.  The reason why the heart becomes impure is that there isavidyā(ignorance), because of which we identify with the body.  Because of this misidentification, we think of the body as the self, and hence create bodily desires thinking they will give happiness to the self.  Fulfillment of such material desires further leads to lust, anger, greed, and all the other impurities of the heart.  As long as the ignorance remains, even if the heart is cleansed, it will again become impure.  Devotion ultimately results in realized knowledge of the soul and God, which in turn destroys the ignorance of material existence.  The benefits of bhakti are described in the Bhakti Rasāmṛit Sindhu as follows:kleśhas tu pāpaṁ tadbījam avidyā cheti te tridhā(1.1.18)  “Bhakti destroys the three poisons—pāp(sins),bīja(the seed of sins),avidyā(the ignorance in the heart).”  Only when the three are completely destroyed, does the heart become truly and permanently pure.Pratyakṣhameans “directly perceptible.”  The practice of the science of bhakti begins with a leap of faith and results in direct perception of God.  It is not unlike the methodology of other sciences, where we begin an experiment with a hypothesis and conclude with a verified result.Dharmyammeans “virtuous.”  Devotion performed without desire for material rewards is the most virtuous action.  It is continuously nourished by righteous acts such as service to the Guru.Kartum susukhammeans “very easy to practice.”  God does not need anything from us; He is attained very naturally if we can learn to love Him.When this is the sovereign science and it is easy to practice, then why do people not apply themselves to learning it?  Shree Krishna explains this next."

They repeatedly come back to this world in the cycle of birth and death.","In the last two verses, Shree Krishna promised knowledge and then qualified it with eight merits.  It is mentioned here as “this dharma,” or the path of loving devotion to God.No matter how wonderful the knowledge and how effective the path, it remains useless to one who refuses to walk on it.  As explained in the previous verse, direct perception of God comes later; initially, a leap of faith is required to begin the process.  The Bhakti Rasāmṛit Sindhu (1.4.15) states:ādau śhraddhā tataḥ sādhusaṅgo ’tha bhajanakriyā“The first step in the path to God-realization is to have faith.  Then one begins participating insatsaṅg(spiritual programs).  This leads to the personal practice of devotion.”Often people say that they are only willing to believe in what they can directly perceive, and since there is no immediate perception of God, they do not believe in Him.  However, the fact is that we believe in so many things in the world too, without direct perception of them.  A judge delivers judgment upon a case concerning an event that took place many years in the past.  If the judge adopted the philosophy of believing only what he or she had directly experienced, then the entire legal system would fail.  A President administers a country on the basis of reports from all over the country.  It is impossible for him to visit and see all the villages and cities within his domain.  Now, if he was not willing to believe these reports, on the grounds that he had no direct perception of what was happening, how would he be able to administer the whole country?  So, even in material activities, faith is required at every step.  The Bible states this very nicely:  “We walk by faith, and not by sight.” (2 Corinthians 5:7)There is a beautiful story regarding perception of God.  A king once accosted a sadhu with the statement, “I do not believe in God because I cannot see Him.”  The sadhu asked for a cow to be brought to king’s court.  The king obliged and ordered his servants to bring a cow.  The sadhu then requested that it be milked.  The king again instructed his servants to do as the sadhu wanted.  The sadhu asked, “O King!  Do you believe that this milk, freshly taken out from the cow, contains butter?”  The king said he had full faith that it did.  The sadhu said, “You cannot see the butter in the milk.  Then why do you believe it is there?”  The king replied, “We cannot see it at present because the butter is pervading the milk, but there is a process for seeing it.  If we convert the milk into yogurt, and then churn the yogurt, the butter will become visible.”  The sadhu said, “Like the butter in the milk, God is everywhere.  If we cannot immediately perceive Him, we should not jump to the conclusion that there is no God.  There is a process for perceiving Him; if we are willing to have faith and follow the process, we will then get direct perception of God and become God-realized.”Belief in God is not a natural process that we as human beings just follow.  We have to exercise our free will and actively make a decision to have faith in God.  In the assembly of the Kauravas, when Dushasan endeavored to disrobe Draupadi, Lord Krishna saved her from shame and embarrassment by lengthening her sari.  All the Kauravas present saw this miracle, but refused to have faith in the omnipotence of Shree Krishna and come to their senses.  The Supreme Lord says in this verse that those who choose not to have faith in the spiritual path remain bereft of divine wisdom and continue rotating in the cycle of life and death."

All living beings dwell in Me, but I do not dwell in them.","The Vedic philosophy does not accept the concept of God creating the world and then peeping into it from the seventh heaven to check whether His world is running all right.  They repeatedly propound the theme of God being all-pervading in the world:eko devaḥ sarvabhūteṣhu gūḍhaḥ sarvavyāpī(Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad 6.11)“There is one God; He is seated in everyone’s heart; He is also everywhere in the world.”īśhāvāsyam idam sarvaṁ yat kiñcha jagatyāṁ jagat(Īśhopaniṣhad 1)“God is everywhere in the world.”puruṣha evedaṁ sarvaṁ, yad bhūtaṁ yachcha bhavyam(Puruṣh Sūktam)“God pervades everything that has existed and all that will exist.”This concept of God being everywhere is understood subjectively.  Some Eastern philosophers claim that the world is apariṇām(transformation) of God.  For example, milk is an unadulterated substance.  In contact with acid, it transforms to yogurt.  Thus, yogurt is apariṇām(effect or product) of milk, when it is transformed.  Similarly, the protagonists ofpariṇāmvādastate that God has transformed into the world.Other philosophers claim that the world isvivarta(to mistake one object for another).  For example, in the darkness a rope may be mistaken for a snake.  In the moonlight, a shining oyster may be mistaken for silver.  Similarly, they say that there is only God and no world; what we are seeing as the world is actually Brahman.However, according to verses 7.4 and 7.5, the world is neitherpariṇāmnorvivarta.  It is created from the material energy of God, called Mayaśhakti.  The souls too are the energy of God, but they are His superior energy, calledJīvaśhakti.  Therefore, the world and all the souls in it are both God’s energies and are within His personality.  However, Shree Krishna also says that He does not dwell in the living beings, i.e. the infinite is not contained by the finite beings.  That is because He is far more than the sum total of these two energies.  Just as an ocean throws up many waves, and these waves are a part of the ocean, but the ocean is much more than the sum total of the waves,  similarly too, the souls and Maya exist within the personality of God, yet He is beyond them."

Behold the mystery of My divine energy!  Although I am the Creator and Sustainer of all living beings, I am not influenced by them or by material nature.","Beyond the two energies mentioned in the purport to the previous verse—MayaśhaktiandJīvaśhakti—there is a third energy of God.  This is calledYogmayaśhakti, which He refers to in this verse, as divine energy.Yogmayais God’s all-powerful energy.  It is calledkartum-akartum-samarthaḥ, or “that which can make the impossible possible,” and is responsible for many of the amazing things we attribute to His personality.  For example, God is seated in our hearts, yet we have no perception of Him.  This is because His divineYogmayapower keeps us aloof from Him.Similarly, God also keeps Himself aloof from the influence of Maya.  In the Bhagavatam, the Vedas praise the Lord:vilajjamānayā yasya sthātumīkṣhā-pathe ’muyā(2.5.13)“Maya feels embarrassed to even stand before God.”  Isn’t it a wonder that although God pervades Maya, the material energy, yet He is aloof from it?  This is again by the mysterious power ofYogmaya.If the world could influence God, then when it decays or is destroyed, His nature and personality will also deteriorate.  But despite all modifications in the world, God remains established in His personality.  Accordingly, the Vedas call God by the nameDaśhāṅgulī, or “ten fingers.”  He is in the world, and yet ten fingers beyond it—untouched by it."

They do not know the divinity of My personality, as the Supreme Lord of all beings.","Good teachers occasionally use strong words to jostle their students out of the complacence of shallow thinking, into a deeper state of thoughtfulness.  Here, Shree Krishna uses the wordmūḍha, which means “dim-witted,” to describe those who deny the divinity of His personal form.Those who say that God is only formless and cannot manifest in a personal form, contradict the definition of God as being all-mighty and all-powerful.  The Supreme Lord has created this entire world full of forms, shapes, and colors.  If He can do such an amazing feat of creating myriad forms in the world, can He not create a form for Himself?  Or is it that God says, “I do not have the power to manifest in a personal form, and hence I am only formless light.”  To say that He cannot possess a personal form makes Him incomplete.We tiny souls also possess forms.  If one holds that God cannot possess a form, then the corollary is that He has even less power than us a human beings.  For God to be perfect and complete, He must have both attributes to His personality—a personal aspect and a formless aspect.  The Vedic scriptures state:apaśhyaṁ gopāṁ anipadyamānamā(Ṛig Veda 1.22.164 sūkta 31)“I had the vision of God as a boy who is never annihilated, and who appeared in a family of cowherds.”dwibhūjaṁ mauna mudrāḍhyaṁ vana mālinamīśhwaram(Gopāl Tāpani Upaniṣhad 1.13)“The Lord, wearing a garland of forest flowers, plays His flute, enchantingly forming themauna mudrāwith His hands.”gūḍhaṁ paraṁ brahma manuṣhya-liṅgam(Bhagavatam 7.15.75)“The deepest knowledge is that God accepts a human-like form.”yatrāvatīrṇo bhagavān paramātmā narākṛitiḥ(Bhagavatam 9.23.20)“At that time, the Supreme Lord, who possesses all opulences, descended in a human-like form.”īśhwaraḥ paramaḥ kṛiṣhṇaḥ sachchidānanda vigrahaḥanādirādir govindaḥ sarvakāraṇa kāraṇam(Brahma Samhitā 5.1)In this verse, Brahma prays to Shree Krishna, “I worship Lord Krishna whose form is eternal, all-knowing, and blissful.  He is without beginning and end, and is the cause of all causes.”However, in regard to the personal form of God, we must keep in mind that it is a divine form, which means it is devoid of all the defects found in material forms.  The form of God issat-chit-ānand—it is eternal, full of knowledge, and constituted of divine bliss.asyāpi deva vapuṣho mad-anugrahasyasvechchhā-mayasya na tu bhūta-mayasya ko ’pi(Bhagavatam 10.14.2)In this verse, Lord Brahma prays to Shree Krishna, “O Lord, Your body is not made ofpañch mahābhūta(the five great elements); it is divine.  And You have descended in this form by Your own free will, to bestow Your grace upon souls like myself.”In chapter four of the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna stated: “Although I am unborn, the Lord of all living entities, and have an imperishable nature, yet I appear in this world by virtue ofYogmaya, my divine power.” (4.6)  This means that not only does God possess a form, but He also descends in the world as an Avatar.Since we souls have been taking births in the world from time immemorial, it is plausible that we were present in the human form on the earth when a previous descension of God was present on the earth.  It is even possible that we saw the descension.  However, the limitation was that God’s form was divine and we possessed material eyes.  So when we saw Him with our eyes, we were unable to recognize the divinity of His personality.The divine nature of God’s form is such that His divinity is perceived by each person only to the extent of his or her spiritual power.  When those who are influenced bysattva guṇasee Him, they think, “Shree Krishna is a special person. He is very competent but is definitely not God.”  When those under the spell ofrajo guṇasee Him, they say, “There is nothing special in Him.  He is very much like us.”  When those dominated bytamo guṇasee Him, they think, “He is egotistic and characterless, much worse than us.”  It is only the God-realized saints who can recognize Him as God, since they have received divine vision by His grace.  And so, Shree Krishna says that the unaware materially conditioned souls do not know Him when He takes an avatar in the world."

They engage in My devotion with their minds fixed exclusively on Me.","Shree Krishna’s style of discourse is that He drives the point home by making starkly contrasting comparisons.  After describing the ways of the deluded and confused, He now talks about the great souls.  Material life is a prolonged dream, which is being experienced by the souls who are sleeping under the sway of the material energy.  In contrast, the great souls are those who have woken up from their ignorance and brushed aside material consciousness like a bad dream.  Released from the grips of the material energy, Maya, they are now under the shelter of the divineYogmayaenergy.  Such enlightened souls have woken up to the spiritual reality of their eternal relationship with God.Just as God has both aspects to His personality—the formless and the personal form—HisYogmayaenergy also possesses both aspects.  It is a formless energy, but it also manifests in the personal form as Radha, Sita, Durga, Lakshmi, Kali, Parvati, etc.  All these divine personalities are manifestations of the divine energy of God, and they are all non-different from each other, just as Krishna, Ram, Shiv, Narayan, etc. are non-different forms of the one God.Brahma Vaivarta Purāṇ states:yathā tvaṁ rādhikā devī goloke gokule tathāvaikuṇṭhe cha mahālakṣhmī bhavati cha sarasvatīkapilasya priyā kāntā bhārate bhāratī satīdwāravatyāṁ mahālakṣhmī bhavatī rukmiṇī satītvaṁ sītā mithilāyāṁ cha tvachchhāyā draupadī satīrāvaṇena hṛitā tvaṁ cha tvaṁ cha rāmasya kāminī“O Radha, You are the Divine Goddess of Golok (Shree Krishna’s divine Abode) and Gokul (Shree Krishna’s Abode in the material realm, when He descended on earth 5,000 years ago).  You exist in Vaikunth (Lord Vishnu’s Abode) as Mahalakshmi.  You are the consort of Lord Kapil (one of the descensions of God).  You reside in Dwaraka as Rukmini (the wife of Shree Krishna).  You manifested as Sita in the city of Mithila.  The wife of the Pandavas, Draupadi, was like a manifestation of Your shadow.  It was You who was kidnapped by Ravan in the form of Sita, and You are the wife of Lord Ram.”In this verse, Shree Krishna mentions that great souls take shelter of the divine energy of God.  The reason is that divine grace, knowledge, love, etc. are all God’s divine energies, and are all subservient to the divineYogmayaenergy, which is Radha.  Hence, by the grace ofYogmaya, one receives the love, knowledge, and grace of God.  Great souls, who receive divine grace, become endowed with divine love, and engage in uninterrupted devotion toward God."

I am immortality as well as death personified, O Arjun.  I am the spirit as well as matter.","The Puranas describe that when God first created the universe, He manifested the first-born Brahma and entrusted him with the work of further creation.  Brahma was bewildered by the task of creating the materials and the life-forms in the universe from the subtle material energy.  Then God revealed knowledge unto him, which is called the Chatuḥśhlokī Bhāgavat (the four-versed Bhagavatam), on the basis of which Brahma proceeded to create the world.  Its first verse states very emphatically:ahamevāsamevāgre nānyadyatsadasat parampaśhchādahaṁ yadetachcha yo ’vaśhiṣhyeta so ’smyaham(Bhagavatam 2.9.32)Shree Krishna tells Brahma: “I am all that is.  Prior to creation, I alone existed.  Now that creation has come about, whatever is in the form of the manifested world is my very self.  After dissolution, I alone will exist.  There is nothing apart from Me.”The above truth implies that the material with which we worship is also God.  When people venerate the holy Ganges, they immerse the lower half of their body in the river.  Then they lift water in their palms and pour it into the Ganges.  In this way, they use the Ganges water itself to worship it.  Similarly, when God is all that exists, then the material for worshipping Him is also non-different from Him.  Thus, as previously stated in verses 16 and 17, Shree Krishna reveals that He is the Vedas, the sacrificial fire, the syllable “Om,” the clarified butter, and the act of offering.  No matter what the form and sentiment of our devotion, there is nothing apart from God that we can offer to Him.  Nevertheless, it is the sentiment of love that pleases God, not the material of the offering."

They perform the ritualistic ceremonies of the Vedas.  This science ofkarm kāṇḍ(Vedic rituals) is referred to astrai-vidyā.People who are fascinated by the science oftrai-vidyāworship the celestial gods, such as Indra, through the performance ofyajñas(fire sacrifices) and other rituals.  They worship the Supreme Lord indirectly because they do not realize that it is He alone who sanctions the gifts that the celestial gods bestow.  Ritualistic ceremonies are considered good deeds, but they are not counted as devotion.  The performers of ritualistic ceremonies do not get released from the cycle of life and death.  They go to the higher planes of existence within the material universe, such as abode of Indra, the king of heaven.  There, they enjoy exquisite celestial delights that are thousands of times more pleasurable than the sensual pleasures available on the earth.In the following verse, Shree Krishna points out the defect in celestial pleasures."

Thus, those who follow the Vedic rituals, desiring objects of enjoyment, repeatedly come and go in this world.","Shree Krishna explains in this verse that the celestial delights of the heavenly abodes are temporary.  After people who have been promoted there have fully enjoyed heavenly pleasures and exhausted their merits, they are sent back to the earthly plane.  Thus, attaining promotion to the heavenly abodes does not fulfill the eternal quest of the soul.  We have all been there many times in endless past lifetimes, and yet the hunger of the soul for infinite Bliss has not yet been satiated.  All the Vedic scriptures support this belief:tāvat pramodate swarge yāvat puṇyaṁ samāpyatekṣhīṇapuṇyaḥ patatyarvāganichchhan kāla-chālitaḥ(Bhagavatam 11.10.26)“Residents of heaven enjoy the celestial delights until their merits have been exhausted.  Then they are reluctantly forced to fall back to the lower abodes by the passage of time.”swargahu swalpa anta dukhadāī(Ramayan)“The attainment of heaven is temporary, and is followed by miseries.”Just as a football gets kicked all over the field, Maya is kicking the soul around in forgetfulness of God.  Sometimes it goes to the lower abodes, while sometimes to the higher abodes.  Amongst these multitudes of forms it receives, across the lower and higher abodes, only the human form offers the facility for God-realization.  Hence, the scriptures state that even the celestial gods pray to be given birth as a human being, so that they may rectify their previous mistake of going to heaven, and strive toward God-realization.durlabhaṁ mānuṣhaṁ janma prārthayate tridaśhairapi(Nārad Purāṇ)“The human form is exceedingly rare.  Even the celestial gods pray to attain it.”  Thus, Lord Ram instructed the residents of Ayodhya:baṛeñ bhāga mānuṣha tanu pāvā, sura durlabha saba granthanhi gāvā(Ramayan)“O people of Ayodhya, you all are extremely fortunate to have been bestowed a human birth, which is exceedingly rare and is desired even by the residents of heaven.”  When the celestial beings long for a human birth, then why should we humans seek promotion to the celestial abodes?  Rather, we should aim for God-realization by engaging in devotion to the Supreme Lord."

To them, whose minds are always absorbed in Me, I provide what they lack and preserve what they already possess.","A mother never thinks of deserting her newborn helpless child who is entirely dependent upon her.  The supreme and eternal mother of the soul is God.  In this verse, God offers  motherly assurance to souls who surrender exclusively to Him.  The words used arevahāmi aham,meaning “I personally carry the burden of maintaining My devotees,” just as a married man carries the burden of maintaining his wife and children.  God promises two things.  The first is yog—He bestows His devotees the spiritual assets they do not possess.  The second iskṣhem—He protects the spiritual assets that His devotees already possess.However, the condition He has placed for this is exclusive surrender.  This can again be understood through the same analogy of the mother and child.  A newborn baby is fully dependent upon its mother, who takes care of the baby’s welfare entirely.  The baby simply cries whenever it needs anything; the mother cleans it, feeds it, bathes it, etc.  But when the baby becomes a five-year old child, it begins doing some actions for itself.  To that extent the mother reduces her responsibilities.  And when the same child becomes a youth and assumes all responsibilities, the mother relinquishes her responsibilities further.  Now if the father comes home and asks, “Where is our son?” the mother replies, “He has not returned home after school.  He must have gone for a movie with his friends.”  Her attitude is now more neutral toward him.  But when the same boy was a five-year old, and had gotten delayed by ten minutes in returning home from school, both the mother and father would begin worrying, “What has happened?  He is a small child.  Let’s hope he has not met with an accident.  Let us phone the school and find out.”In this way, as the boy keeps assuming more responsibilities, his mother keeps relinquishing her responsibilities.  God’s law is exactly the same.  When we act from our independent will, thinking that we are the doers of our actions, and depend upon our own prowess and abilities, God does not bestow His grace.  He merely notes our karmas and gives the result.  When we surrender partially to Him and partially depend upon material crutches, God also partially bestows His grace upon us.  And when we offer ourselves exclusively to Him,māmekaṁ śharaṇaṁ vraja, God bestows His complete grace and takes full responsibility, by preserving what we have and providing what we lack."

But they do so by the wrong method.","Having described the position of those who worship the Supreme Lord, Shree Krishna now explains the situation of those who worship the lower gods for material gains.  They are also endowed with faith, and they may have their supplications answered by the celestial gods, but their understanding is incomplete.  They do not realize that the celestial beings receive their powers from God Himself.  Hence, they also worship the Supreme Divine Personality, albeit indirectly.  For example, if a government officer redresses a complaint by a citizen, he is not credited with being benevolent.  He is merely utilizing the powers in his jurisdiction that have been bestowed upon him by the government.  Similarly, all the powers of the celestial gods come from the Supreme Lord.  Thus, those with superior understanding do not go by the indirect route; they worship the source of all powers, which is God Himself.  Such worship that is offered to the Supreme Lord automatically satisfies the entire creation:yathā taror mūla-niṣhechanenatṛipyanti tatskandhabhujopaśhākhāḥprāṇopahārāchcha yathendriyāṇāṁtathaiva sarvārhaṇam achyutejyā(Bhagavatam 4.31.14)“When we water the root of a tree, its trunk, branches, twigs, leaves, and flowers all become nourished.  When we put food in our mouth, it nourishes the life airs and the senses automatically.  In the same way, by worshipping the Supreme Lord, all His parts, including thedevatāsare also worshipped.”  However, if we begin watering the leaves of a tree, while neglecting its roots, the tree will perish.  Likewise, the worship offered  to the celestial gods certainly makes its way to the Supreme Lord, but such devotees do not get spiritual benefits.This is elaborated in the next verse."

But those who fail to realize My divine nature must be reborn.,"Shree Krishna now explains the drawback in worshipping the celestial gods.  By virtue of the powers bestowed upon them by the Supreme Lord, they do possess the ability to grant material favors, but they cannot liberate their devotees from the cycle of life and death.  They can only offer to others what they themselves possess.  When the celestial gods themselves are not liberated fromsamsara, then how can they release their devotees from it?  On the other hand, those whose understanding is proper offer their entire veneration at the feet of God Himself, and when their devotion reaches the stage of perfection, they go beyond the world of mortals to the divine Abode."

With your mind attached to Me through renunciation, you will be liberated and will reach Me.","Every action has defects, just as fire is covered by smoke.  When we walk on the earth, we unknowingly kill millions of tiny living entities.  In our occupational duties, no matter how careful we are in the fulfillment of our duties, we still end up harming the environment and hurting others.  Even if we eat a cup of yogurt, we still incur the sin of destroying the living entities that reside in it.  Some religious sects try to reduce this involuntary killing by tying a cloth over their mouth.  Even this does not fully eliminate the destruction of living entities in our breath.When we perform our actions with the intention of fulfilling our self-interest, we are culpable for the sins we commit, knowingly or unknowingly.  In accordance with the law of karma, we have to reap their karmic reactions.  Good works can also be binding because they oblige the soul to go to the celestial abodes to enjoy their results.  Thus, both bad and good karmas result in the continuity of the cycle of birth and death.   However, in this verse, Shree Krishna gives a simple solution for destroying all karmic reactions of work.  He uses the wordsanyāsyog, meaning renunciation of selfishness.  He says that when we dedicate our actions for the pleasure of the Lord, we are freed from the fetters of both good and bad results.Those who establish themselves in such consciousness are calledyogyuktātmā(united in consciousness with God).  Such yogis becomejīvan mukt(liberated in consciousness) even in this body.  And, upon leaving their mortal frame, they receive a divine body and eternal service in the divine Abode of God."

But the devotees who worship Me with love reside in Me and I reside in them.,"We all intuitively believe that if there is a God, He must be perfectly just; there cannot be an unjust God.  People suffering injustice in the world make statements such as, “Mr. Billionaire, you have the power of money on your side. Do what you like.  God will settle our dispute.  He is watching and will definitely punish you.  You cannot escape.”  This sort of statement does not indicate that the person making it is a saint, possessing absolute faith in God, for even common persons believe that God is perfectly just.However, the previous verse by Shree Krishna creates the doubt that God is partial toward His devotees, because while everyone is subject to the law of karma, God releases His devotees from it.  Isn’t this symptomatic of the defect of partiality?  Shree Krishna feels it necessary to clarify this point and begins the verse by sayingsamo’ ham,meaning, “No, no, I am equal to all.  But I have a uniform law in accordance with which I bestow My grace.”  This law was previously stated in verse 4.11: “In whatever way people surrender unto Me, I reciprocate accordingly. Everyone follows my path, knowingly or unknowingly, O son of Pritha.”The rainwater falls equally upon the earth.  Yet, the drop that falls on the cornfields gets converted into grain; the drop that falls on the desert bush gets converted into a thorn; the drop that falls in the gutter becomes dirty water; and the drop that falls in the oyster becomes a pearl.  There is no partiality on the part of the rain, since it is equitable in bestowing its grace upon the land.  The raindrops cannot be held responsible for this variation in results, which are a consequence of the nature of the recipient.  Similarly, God states here that He is equally disposed toward all living beings, and yet, those who do not love Him are bereft of the benefits of His grace because their hearts are unsuitable vessels for receiving it.So, what can people do whose hearts are impure?  Shree Krishna now reveals the purifying power of bhakti."

O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that no devotee of Mine is ever lost.","How can devotees be considered venerable, merely for having made the correct resolve?  Shree Krishna explains that if they continue the process of exclusive devotion with unflinching faith in God, their hearts will become purified and they will swiftly develop saintly virtues.Divine virtues emanate from God Himself.  He is perfectly just, truthful, compassionate, loving, merciful, etc.  Since we souls are His tiny parts, we are all naturally drawn to these godly qualities.  But the process of becoming virtuous remains an elusive mystery.  From childhood, we have heard that we must speak the truth, serve others, be free from anger, etc. and yet we are unable to put those teachings into practice for the simple reason that our mind is impure.  Without purification of the mind, blemishes of character cannot be eradicated fully and permanently.  Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj declares the irrefutable truth regarding developing divine virtues:satya ahinsā ādi mana! bina hari bhajana na pāyajala te ghṛita nikale nahīñ, koṭina kariya upāya(Bhakti Śhatak verse 35)“Oil stains on a cloth cannot be removed by water, no matter how much we try.  Similarly, truthfulness, non-violence, and other virtuous qualities cannot be acquired without engaging in devotion to God.”  These qualities manifest when the mind is purified; and the purification of the mind cannot take place without attaching it to the all-pure God.Further, Shree Krishna asks Arjun to boldly declare that His devotees will never perish.  He does not say, “Thejñānī(person of knowledge) will not be lost.”  Nor does He say, “Thekarmī(performer of rituals) shall not perish.”  He makes His promise for Hisbhaktas(devotees), saying that “they shall never come to ruin.”  Thereby, He reiterates what He had stated in verse 9.22, that He personally carries the burden of maintaining those who depend upon Him and engage in exclusive devotion unto Him.It may seem intriguing why Shree Krishna asks Arjun to make this statement, instead of declaring it Himself?  The reason is that under special circumstances the Lord sometimes breaks His word, but He never permits His devotees’ word to be broken.  For example, Shree Krishna had resolved that He would not lift weapons during the Mahabharat war.  But when Bheeshma, considered the perfect devotee, resolved that he would either kill Arjun by sunset the next day or make the Lord lift weapons to protect him, Shree Krishna broke His own vow to protect the vow made by Bheeshma.  Thus, to reaffirm the strength of His statement, Shree Krishna here says, “Arjun, you declare that My devotee will never perish, for I shall guarantee that your word will be kept.”"

Having dedicated your mind and body to Me, you will certainly come to Me.","Having stressed bhakti, the path of devotion, throughout this chapter, Shree Krishna now concludes it by entreating Arjun to become His devotee.  He asks Arjun to unite his consciousness with God in true Yog, by worshipping Him, engaging the mind in meditation upon His divine form, and offering obeisance in pure humility to Him.Namaskuru(the act of humble obeisance) effectively neutralizes vestiges of egotism that may arise in the performance of devotion.  Thus, free from pride, with the heart immersed in devotion, one should dedicate all one’s thoughts and actions to the Supreme.  Shree Krishna assures Arjun that such complete communion with Him throughbhakti-yogwill definitely result in the attainment of God-realization; of this, there should be no doubt."
