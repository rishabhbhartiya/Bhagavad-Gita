Please tell me decisively which of the two is more beneficial?","This is the fifth of Arjun’s sixteen questions.  Shree Krishna praised both the renunciation of works and work with devotion.  Arjun is confused by these apparently equivocal instructions and wishes to understand which of the two is more auspicious for him.  Let us review the context of the question.The first chapter described the nature of Arjun’s grief and created the setting for Shree Krishna to begin to relate spiritual knowledge to him.  In the second chapter, Shree Krishna revealed to Arjun the science of the self and explained that since the soul is immortal, nobody would die in the war, and hence it was foolish to lament.  He then reminded Arjun that hiskarm(social duty) as a warrior was to fight the war on the side of righteousness.  But, sincekarmbinds one to the fruits of actions, Shree Krishna encouraged Arjun to dedicate the fruits of his works to God.  His actions would then becomekarm-yog, or “united with God through works.”In the third chapter, the Supreme Lord explained that performing one’s duties is necessary because it helps to purify the mind.  But He also said that a person who has already developed purity of mind is not obliged to perform any social duty (verse 3.17).In the fourth chapter, the Lord explained the various kinds of sacrifices (works that can be done for the pleasure of God).  He concluded by saying that sacrifice performed in knowledge is better than mechanical ritualistic sacrifice.  He also said that all sacrifice ends in the knowledge of one’s relationship with God.  Finally, in verse 4.41, He introduced the principle ofkarm sanyās, in which ritualistic duties and social obligations are renounced and one engages in devotional service with the body, mind, and soul.These instructions perplexed Arjun.  He thought thatkarm sanyās(renunciation of works) andkarm-yog(work in devotion) have opposite natures, and it is not possible to perform both simultaneously.  Hence, he raises his doubt before Shree Krishna."
1,5,Karm Sanyās Yog,The Yog of Renunciation,2,श्रीभगवानुवाच |संन्यास: कर्मयोगश्च नि:श्रेयसकरावुभौ |तयोस्तु कर्मसंन्यासात्कर्मयोगो विशिष्यते || 2||,śhrī bhagavān uvāchasannyāsaḥ karma-yogaśh cha niḥśhreyasa-karāvubhautayos tu karma-sannyāsāt karma-yogo viśhiṣhyate,śhrī-bhagavān uvācha—the Supreme Lord said;sanyāsaḥ—renunciation;karma-yogaḥ—working in devotion;cha—and;niḥśhreyasa-karau—lead to the supreme goal;ubhau—both;tayoḥ—of the two;tu—but;karma-sanyāsāt—renunciation of actions;karma-yogaḥ—working in devotion;viśhiṣhyate—is superior,shri bhagavan uvachasannyasah karma-yogash cha nihshreyasa-karavubhautayos tu karma-sannyasat karma-yogo vishishyate,BG 5.2:The Supreme Lord said: Both the path ofkarm sanyās(renunciation of actions) andkarm yog(working in devotion) lead to the supreme goal. Butkarm yogis superior tokarm sanyās.,"In this verse, Shree Krishna compareskarm sanyāsandkarm-yog.  It is a very deep verse; so let’s understand it one word at a time.Akarm yogiis one who does both, spiritual and social, duties.  Social duties are done with the body while the mind is attached to God.  Jagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj states:sochu mana yaha karm mama saba lakhata hari guru pyāre(Sādhan Bhakti Tattva)“Dear one!  Think always that all your actions are being observed by God and Guru.”  This is thesādhanāofkarm-yog, by which we gradually elevate ourselves from bodily consciousness to spiritual consciousness.Karm sanyāsis for elevated souls, who have already risen beyond the bodily platform.  Akarm sanyāsīis one who discards social duties due to complete absorption in God, and engages entirely in the performance of spiritual duties (devotional service to God).  This sentiment ofkarm sanyāswas nicely expressed by Lakshman, when Lord Ram asked him to fulfill his worldly duties:more sabai eka tumha swāmī, dīnabandhu ura antarayāmī(Ramayan)Lakshman said to Ram, “You are my Master, Father, Mother, Friend, and everything.  I will only fulfill my duty toward You with all my might.  So please do not tell me about any of my bodily duties.”Those who practicekarm sanyāsdo not consider themselves to be the body, and as a result, they do not feel obligated to discharge their bodily duties.  Suchkarm sanyāsīsdedicate their full time and energy to spirituality, whilekarm yogishave to split their time between worldly and spiritual duties.  Thekarm sanyāsīscan thus move much faster toward God, while thekarm yogisare encumbered with social duties.However, in this verse, Shree Krishna extolskarm-yogbeyondkarm sanyāsand recommends it to Arjun as the preferred path.  This is becausekarm sanyāsīsare exposed to a danger.  If, having renounced their duties they cannot absorb their mind in God, they are left neither here nor there.  In India, there are tens of thousands of such sadhus, who felt they were detached, and thus, renounced the world, but their mind was not yet attached to God.  Consequently, they could not experience the divine bliss of the spiritual path.  And so, although wearing the saffron clothes of mendicants, they indulge in grossly sinful activities such as smoking opium.  Only the ignorant mistake their sloth as detachment from the world.On the other hand,karm yogisdo both their worldly duties and spiritual practice.  So if their mind turns away from spirituality, at least they have their work to fall back upon.Karm-yogis thus the safer path for majority of the people, whilekarm sanyāsis only to be pursued under the expert guidance of a Guru."

Free from all dualities, they are easily liberated from the bonds of material energy.","Karm yogiscontinue to discharge their worldly duties while internally practicing detachment.  Hence, they accept both positive and negative outcomes with equanimity, as the grace of God.  The Lord has designed this world so beautifully that it makes us experience both happiness and distress for our gradual elevation.  If we continue to lead our regular lives and tolerate whatever comes our way, while happily doing our duty, the world naturally pushes us toward gradual spiritual elevation.There is a sweet story that illustrates this concept.  There was once a piece of wood.  It went to a sculptor and said, “Can you please make me beautiful?”  The sculptor said, “I am ready to do that.  But are you ready for it?”  The wood replied, “Yes, I am also ready.”  The sculptor took out his tools and began hammering and chiseling.  The wood screamed, “What are you doing?  Please stop!  This is so painful.”  The sculptor replied wisely, “If you wish to become beautiful, you will have to bear the pain.”  “All right,” said the wood, “Go ahead and do it.  But please be gentle and considerate.”  The sculptor continued his work again.  The wood kept screaming, “Enough for today; I can’t bear it any further.  Please do it tomorrow.”  The sculptor was undeterred in his task, and in a few days, the wood was transformed into a beautiful deity, fit to sit on the altar of the temple.In the same way, our hearts are rough and unfinished because of endless lifetimes of attachment in the world.  If we wish to become internally beautiful, we must be willing to tolerate pain and let the world do its job of purifying us.  Sokarm yogiswork with devotion, are equipoised in the results, and practice attaching their mind to God."

Those who are truly learned say that by applying ourselves to any one of these paths, we can achieve the results of both.","Here, Shree Krishna uses the wordsānkhyato refer tokarm sanyās, or the renunciation of actions with the cultivation of knowledge.  It is important to understand here that renunciation is of two kinds:phalgu vairāgyaandyukt vairāgya.Phalgu vairāgyais where people look upon the world as cumbersome, and renounce it with the desire of getting rid of responsibilities and hardships.  Suchphalgu vairāgyais an escapist attitude and is unstable.  The renunciation of such persons is motivated by the desire to run away from difficulties.  When such persons encounter difficulties on the spiritual path, they become detached from there as well, and desire to run back to worldly life.Yukt vairāgyais where people see the whole world as the energy of God.  They do not see what they possess as belonging to them, and do not wish to enjoy it for themselves.  Instead, they are motivated by the desire to serve God with whatever He has given to them.Yukt vairāgyais stable and undeterred by difficulties.Thekarm yogis, while conducting their daily duties externally, develop the sentiment ofyukt vairāgya, or stable renunciation.  They see themselves as the servants and God as the enjoyer, and hence they become fixed in the consciousness of doing everything for His pleasure.  Thus, their internal state becomes the same as that of thekarm sanyāsīs, who are completely absorbed in divine consciousness.  Externally, they may appear to be worldly people, but internally they are no less thansanyāsīs.The Puranas and Itihās relate the examples of great kings in Indian history, who, though externally discharging their kingly duties with diligence and living in royal opulence, were mentally completely absorbed in God-consciousness.  Prahlad, Dhruv, Ambarish, Prithu, Vibheeshan, Yudhishthir, etc. were all such exemplarykarm yogis.  The Shreemad Bhagavatam states:gṛihītvāpīndriyair arthān yo na dveṣhṭi na hṛiṣhyativiṣhṇor māyām idaṁ paśhyan sa vai bhāgavatottamaḥ(11.2.48)“One who accepts the objects of the senses, neither yearning for them nor running away from them, in the divine consciousness that everything is the energy of God and is to be used in His service, such a person is the highest devotee.”  Thus, the truly learned see no difference betweenkarm-yogandkarm sanyās.  By following one of them, the results of both are achieved."

Hence, those who seekarm sanyāsandkarm yogto be identical, truly see things as they are.","In spiritual practice, the intention of the mind is what matters, not the external activities.  One may be living in the holy land of Vrindavan, but if the mind contemplates on eatingrasgullāsin Kolkata, one will be deemed to be living in Kolkata.  Conversely, if a person lives amidst the hubbub of Kolkata and keeps the mind absorbed in the divine land of Vrindavan, he will get the benefit of residing there.  All the Vedic scriptures state that our level of consciousness is determined by the state of our mind:mana eva manuṣhyāṇāṁ kāraṇaṁ bandha mokṣhayoḥ(Pañchadaśhī)“The mind is the cause of bondage, and the mind is the cause of liberation.”  Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states the same principle:bandhan aur mokṣha kā, kāraṇ manahi bakhānyāte kauniu bhakti karu, karu mana te haridhyān(Bhakti Śhatak verse 19)“Bondage and liberation depend upon the state of the mind.  Whatever form of devotion you choose to do, keep the mind engaged in meditation upon God.”Those who do not possess this spiritual vision see the external distinction between akarm sanyāsīand akarm yogi, and declare thekarm sanyāsīto be superior because of the external renunciation.  But those who are learned see that both thekarm sanyāsīand thekarm yogihave absorbed their minds in God, and so they are both identical in their internal consciousness."

Though performing all kinds of actions, they are never entangled.","The wordātmāhas been used in multiple ways in the Vedic literature: for God, for the soul, for the mind, and for the intellect.  This verse typifies all these uses.  Shree Krishna describes thekarm yogiwho isyog yukt(united in consciousness with God).  He says that such a noble soul is:  1)viśhuddhātmā, of purified intellect, 2)vijitātmā, who has conquered the mind, and 3)jitendriya, one who has controlled the senses.Suchkarm yogis, with purified intellect, see God situated in all living beings, and behave respectfully toward everyone without attachment.  Since their actions are not motivated by the desire for self-enjoyment, their knowledge is progressively clarified.  As their desires are eliminated, the senses, mind, and intellect that were being propelled for sense pleasures come under control.  These instruments are now available for the service of the Lord.  Devotional service leads to realized knowledge from within.  In this way,karm-yognaturally brings about these successive stages of enlightenment, and hence is no different fromkarm sanyās."

The living entities are deluded because their inner knowledge is covered by ignorance.,"God is not responsible either for anyone’s virtuous deeds or sinful actions.  God’s work in this regard is threefold:  1) He provides the soul with the power to act.  2) Once we have performed actions with the power supplied to us, He notes our actions.  3) He gives us the results of our karmas.The individual soul has the freedom to perform good or bad actions by the exercise of its own free will.  That free will is the basis of the play of creation and it accounts for the varieties of consciousness amongst the souls in existence.  God’s work is like that of an umpire in a cricket match.  He keeps giving the results, “Four runs!”  “Six runs!”  “He’s out!”  The umpire cannot be blamed for the decision, for it was based upon the way the player performed.One may ask why God granted free will to the soul.  It is because the soul is a tiny part of God and it possesses His qualities to a minuscule extent.  God isabhijña swarāṭ(supremely independent), and so the soul also possesses a tiny amount of independence to utilize its senses, mind, and intellect in the manner it wishes.Also, without free will there can be no love.  A machine cannot love since it has no independence to choose.  Only a personality that has the ability to choose possesses the option to love.  Since God has created us to love Him, He has endowed us with free will.  The exercise of our own free will results in good and bad deeds, and we must not blame God for them.In ignorance, some souls do not even realize that they possess the freedom to choose their actions and hold God responsible for their mistakes.  Others realize they possess a free will, but they harbor the pride of doership in the egoistic notion of being the body.  This is again a sign of ignorance.Shree Krishna explains next how such ignorance can be dispelled."

O son of Kunti, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, so the wise do not delight in them.","The senses create sensations of pleasure in contact with the sense objects.  The mind, which is like the sixth sense, derives pleasure from honor, praise, circumstances, success, etc.  All these pleasures of body and mind are known asbhog(material enjoyment).  Such worldly pleasures cannot satisfy the soul for the following reasons:Worldly pleasures are finite, and hence the feeling of deficiency remains inherent in them.  One may feel happiness on becoming a millionaire, but the same millionaire becomes discontented on seeing a billionaire, and thinks, “If only I also had one billion, then I too would be happy.”  In contrast, the bliss of God is infinite, and so it gives complete satisfaction.Worldly pleasures are temporary.  Once they finish, they again leave one with the feeling of misery.  For example, an alcoholic enjoys the pleasure of drinking alcohol at night, but the next morning, the hangover gives him a splitting headache.  However, the bliss of God is eternal, and once attained, it remains forever.Worldly pleasures are insentient, and hence they continuously decrease.  When people see a new Academy Award prize-winning movie, they are overjoyed, but if they have to see the movie a second time to give company to a friend, their joy dries up.  And if a second friend insists that they see it a third time, they say, “Give me any punishment, but don’t ask me to see that movie again.”  The pleasure from material objects keeps decreasing as we enjoy it.  In Economics, this is defined as the Law of Diminishing Returns.  But the bliss of God is sentient; it issat-chit-ānand(eternal ever-fresh divine bliss).  Hence, one can go on chanting the same divine Name of God all day long, and relish ever-new devotional satisfaction in it.No sane person enjoying a delicious dessert would be willing to give it up and eat mud instead.  Similarly, when one begins to enjoy divine bliss, the mind loses all taste for material pleasures.  Those endowed with the faculty of discrimination understand the above three drawbacks of material pleasures, and restrain their senses from them.Shree Krishna emphasizes this in the next verse."
