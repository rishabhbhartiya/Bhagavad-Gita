The understanding of the body as the field of activities, and the soul and God as the knowers of the field, this I hold to be true knowledge.","The soul is only the knower of the individual field of its own body.  Even in this limited context, the soul’s knowledge of its field is incomplete.  God is the knower of the fields of all souls, being situated as the Supreme Soul in the heart of all living beings.  Further, God’s knowledge of eachkṣhetrais perfect and complete.  By explaining these distinctions, Shree Krishna establishes the position of the three entities vis-à-vis each other—the material body, the soul, and the Supreme Soul.In the second part of the above verse, He gives His definition of knowledge.  “Understanding of the self, the Supreme Lord, the body, and the distinction amongst these, is true knowledge.”  In this light, persons with PhDs and DLitts may consider themselves to be erudite, but if they do not understand the distinction between their body, the soul, and God, then according to Shree Krishna’s definition, they are really not knowledgeable."

It has been stated in various Vedic hymns, and especially revealed in the Brahma Sūtra, with sound logic and conclusive evidence.","Knowledge is appealing to the intellect when it is expressed with precision and clarity, and is substantiated with sound logic.  Further, for it to be accepted as infallible, it must be confirmed on the basis of infallible authority.  The reference for validating spiritual knowledge is the Vedas.Vedas:  These are not just the name of some books; they are the eternal knowledge of God.  Whenever God creates the world, He manifests the Vedas for the benefit of the souls.  The Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad (4.5.11) states:niḥśhvasitamasya vedāḥ“The Vedas manifested from the breath of God.”  They were first revealed in the heart of the first-born Brahma.  From there, they came down through the oral tradition, and hence, another name for them isŚhruti, or “knowledge received through the ear.”  At the beginning of the age ofKali, Ved Vyas, who was himself a descension of God, put down the Vedas in the form of a book, and divided the one body of knowledge into four portions—Ṛig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sāma Veda, and Atharva Veda.  Hence, he got the nameVed Vyās, or “one who divided the Vedas.”  The distinction must be borne in mind that Ved Vyas is never referred to as the composer of the Vedas but merely the one who divided them.  Hence, the Vedas are also calledapauruṣheya, which means “not created by any person.”  They are respected as the infallible authority for spiritual knowledge.bhūtaṁ bhavyaṁ bhaviṣhyaṁ cha sarvaṁ vedāt prasidhyati(Manu Smṛiti 12.97)“Any spiritual principle must be validated on the authority of the Vedas.”  To elaborate this knowledge of the Vedas, many sages wrote texts and these traditionally became included in the gamut of the Vedic scriptures because they conform to the authority of the Vedas.  Some of the important Vedic scriptures are listed below.Itihās:  These are historical texts, and are two in number, the Ramayan and the Mahabharat.  They describe the history related to two important descensions of God.  The Ramayan was written by Sage Valmiki, and describes theLeelas, or divine Pastimes, of Lord Ram.  Amazingly, it was written by Valmiki before Shree Ram actually displayed HisLeelas.  The great poet Sage was empowered with divine vision, by which he could see the Pastimes Lord Ram would enact on descending in the world.  He thus put them down in 24,000 most beautifully composed Sanskrit verses of the Ramayan.  These verses also contain lessons on ideal behavior in various social roles, such as son, brother, wife, king, and married couples.  The Ramayan has also been written in many regional languages of India, thereby increasing its popularity amongst the people.  The most famous amongst these is the Hindi Ramayan, Ramcharit Manas, written by a great devotee of Lord Ram, Saint Tulsidas.The Mahabharat was written by Sage Ved Vyas.  It contains 100,000 verses and is considered the longest poem in the world.  The divineLeelasof Lord Krishna are the central theme of the Mahabharat.  It is full of wisdom and guidance related to duties in all stages of human life, and devotion to God.  The Bhagavad Gita is a portion of the Mahabharat.  It is the most popular Hindu scripture, since it contains the essence of spiritual knowledge, so beautifully described by Lord Krishna Himself.  It has been translated in many different languages of the world.  Innumerable commentaries have been written on the Bhagavad Gita.Puranas:  There are eighteen Puranas, written by Sage Ved Vyas.  Together, they contain 400,000 verses.  These describe the divine Pastimes of the various forms of God and His devotees.  The Puranas are also full of philosophic knowledge.  They discuss the creation of the universe, its annihilation and recreation, the history of humankind, the genealogy of the celestial gods and the holy sages.  The most important amongst them is theBhāgavat Purāṇ, or the Shreemad Bhagavatam.  It was the last scripture written by Sage Ved Vyas.  In it, he mentions that in this scripture, he is going to reveal the highest dharma of pure selfless love for God.  Philosophically, the Shreemad Bhagavatam begins where the Bhagavad Gita ends.Ṣhaḍ-darśhan:  These come next in importance amongst the Vedic scriptures.  Six sages wrote six scriptures highlighting particular aspects of Hindu philosophy.  These became known as the Ṣhaḍ-darśhan, or six philosophic works.  They are:1. Mīmānsā:  Written by Maharishi (Sage) Jaimini, it describes ritualistic duties and ceremonies.2. Vedānt Darśhan:  Written by Maharishi Ved Vyas, it discusses the nature of the Absolute Truth.3. Nyāya Darśhan:  Written by Maharishi Gautam, it develops a system of logic for understanding life and the Absolute Truth.4. Vaiśheṣhik Darśhan:  Written by Maharishi Kanad, it analyses cosmology and creation from the perspective of its various elements.5. Yog Darśhan:  Written by Maharishi Patañjali, it describes an eightfold path to union with God, beginning with physical postures.6. Sānkhya Darśhan:  Written by Maharishi Kapil, it describes the evolution of the Universe fromprakṛiti, the primordial form of the material energy.Apart from these mentioned above, there are hundreds of other scriptures in the Hindu tradition.  It would be impossible to describe them all here.  Let it suffice to say that the Vedic scriptures are a vast treasure house of divine knowledge revealed by God and the saints for the eternal welfare of all humankind.Amongst these scriptural texts, the Brahma Sūtra (Vedānt Darśhan) is considered as the last word on the topic of the distinction between the soul, the material body, and God.  Hence, Shree Krishna particularly mentions it in the above verse.  “Ved” refers to the Vedas, and“ant”means “the conclusion.”  Consequently, “Vedānt” means “the conclusion of Vedic knowledge.”  Although, the Vedānt Darśhan was written by Sage Ved Vyas, many great scholars accepted it as the reference authority for philosophical dissertation and wrote commentaries on it to establish their unique philosophic viewpoint regarding the soul and God.  Jagadguru Shankaracharya’s commentary on the Vedānt Darśhan is called Śhārīrak Bhāṣhya, which lays the foundation for theadvait-vādtradition of philosophy.  Many of his followers, such as Vachaspati and Padmapada have elaborated upon his commentary.  Jagadguru Nimbarkarcharya wrote the Vedānt Pārijāta Saurabh, which explains thedwait-advait-vādschool of thought.  Jagadguru Ramanujacharya’s commentary is called Śhrī Bhāṣhya, which lays the basis for theviśhiṣhṭ-advait-vādsystem of philosophy.  Jagadguru Madhvacharya’s commentary is called Brahma Sūtra Bhāṣhyam, which is the foundation for thedwait-vādschool of thought.  Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya wrote Aṇu Bhāṣhya, in which he established theśhuddhadvait-vādsystem of philosophy.  Apart from these, some of the other well-known commentators have been Bhat Bhaskar, Yadav Prakash, Keshav, Nilakanth, Vijnanabhikshu, and Baladev Vidyabhushan.Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, himself a Vedic scholar par excellence, did not write any commentary on the Vedānt Darśhan.  He took the view that the writer of the Vedānt, Sage Ved Vyas himself, declared that his final scripture the Shreemad Bhagavatam is its perfect commentary:arthoyaṁ brahmasūtrāṇaṁ sarvopaniṣhadāmapi“The Shreemad Bhagavatam reveals the meaning and the essence of the Vedānt Darśhan and all the Upanishads.”  Hence, out of respect for Ved Vyas, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did not deem it fit to write another commentary on the scripture."

intellectual exercise.  Unlike bookish knowledge that can be cultivated without a change in one’s character, the spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about requires purification of the heart.  (Here, heart does not refer to the physical organ.  The inner apparatus of mind and intellect is also sometimes referred to as the heart.)  These five verses describe the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes that purify one’s life and illuminate it with the light of knowledge.Humbleness.  When we become proud of the attributes of our individual field, such as beauty, intellect, talent, strength, etc. we forget that God has given all these attributes to us.  Pride thus results in distancing our consciousness from God.  It is a big obstacle on the path of self-realization since it contaminates the entire field by affecting the qualities of the mind and intellect.Freedom from hypocrisy.The hypocrite develops an artificial external personality.  A person is defective from inside, but creates a facade of virtuosity on the outside.  Unfortunately, the external display of virtues is skin-deep and hollow.Non-violence.The cultivation of knowledge requires respect for all living beings.  This requires the practice of non-violence.  Hence the scriptures state:ātmanaḥ pratikūlāni pareśhāṁ na samācharet“If you dislike a certain behavior from others, do not behave with them in that manner yourself.”Forgiveness.  It is freedom from ill will even toward those who have harmed one.  Actually, harboring ill will harms oneself more than the other.  By practicing forgiveness, a person of discrimination releases the negativities in the mind and purifies it.Simplicity.  It is straightforwardness in thought, speech, and action.  Straightforwardness in thought includes absence of deceit, envy, crookedness, etc.  Straightforwardness in speech includes absence of taunt, censure, gossip, ornamentation, etc.  Straightforwardness in action includes plainness in living, forthrightness in behavior, etc.Service of the Guru.Spiritual knowledge is received from the Guru.  This imparting of divine knowledge requires the disciple to have an attitude of dedication and devotion toward the Guru.  By serving the Guru, the disciple develops humbleness and commitment that enables the Guru to impart knowledge.  Thus, Shree Krishna explained to Arjun in verse 4.34:  “Learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.  Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him.  Such an enlightened saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.”Cleanliness of body and mind.Purity should be both internal and external.  The Śhāṇdilya Upaniṣhad states:śhauchaṁ nāma dwividhaṁ-bāhyamāntaraṁ cheti(1.1)“There are two types of cleanliness—internal and external.”  External cleanliness is helpful in maintaining good health, developing discipline, and uncluttering the mind.  But mental cleanliness is even more important, and it is achieved by focusing the mind on the all-pure God.  Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:māyādhīn malīn mana, hai anādi kālīn,hari virahānala dhoya jala, karu nirmala bani dīn.(Bhakti Śhatak verse 79)“The material mind is dirty since endless lifetimes.  Purify it in the fire of longing for God, while practicing utmost humility.”Steadfastness.  Self-knowledge and God-realization are not goals that are attainable in a day.  Steadfastness is the persistence to remain on the path until the goal is reached.  The scriptures state:charaivaite charaivate, charan vai madhu vindati“Keep

dirty the mind and intellect.  Self-control prevents the dissipation of the personality through indulgence.Dispassion toward the objects of the senses.It is a stage higher than the self-control mentioned above, in which we restrain ourselves by force.  Dispassion means a lack of taste for sense pleasures that are obstacles on the path of God-realization.Absence of egotism.Egotism is the conscious awareness of “I,” “me,” and “mine.”  This is classified as nescience because it is at the bodily level, arising out of the identification of the self with the body.  It is also called theaham chetanā(pride arising out of the sense of self).  All mystics emphatically declare that to invite God into our hearts, we must get rid of the pride of the self.jaba maiṅ thā taba hari nathīṅ, ab hari hai, maiṅ nāhīṅprem galī ati sankarī, yā meṅ dwe na samāhīṅ(Saint Kabir)“When ‘I’ existed, God was not there; now God exists and ‘I’ do not.  The path of divine love is very narrow; it cannot accommodate both ‘I’ and God.”In the path ofjñāna-yogandaṣhṭāṅg-yog, there are elaboratesādhanāsfor getting rid of theaham chetanā.  But in the path ofbhakti-yog, it gets eliminated very simply.  We adddās(servant) in front ofaham(the sense of self), making itdāsoham(I am the servant of God).  Now the “I” no longer remains harmful and self-consciousness is replaced by God-consciousness.Keeping in mind the evils of birth, disease, old-age and death.If the intellect is undecided about what is more important—material enhancement or spiritual wealth—then it becomes difficult to develop the strong will required for acquiring knowledge of the self.  But when the intellect is convinced about the unattractiveness of the world, it becomes firm in its resolve.  To get this firmness, we should constantly contemplate about the miseries that are an inseparable part of life in the material world.  This is what set the Buddha on the spiritual path.  He saw a sick person, and thought, “O there is sickness in the world.  I will also have to fall sick one day.”  Then He saw an old person, and thought, “There is also old age.  This means that I will also become old one day.”  After that, He saw a dead person, and realized, “This is also a part of existence.  It means that I too will have to die one day.”  The Buddha’s intellect was so perceptive that one exposure to these facts of life made Him renounce worldly existence.  Since we do not have such decisive intellects, we must repeatedly contemplate on these facts to allow the unattractiveness of the world to sink in.Non-attachment.It means dispassion toward the world.  We have only one mind and if we wish to engage it in pursuing spiritual goals, we have to detach it from material objects and persons.  Thesādhakreplaces worldly attachment with love and attachment toward God.Absence of clinging to spouse, children, home, and so on.These are areas where the mind easily becomes attached.  In bodily thinking, one spontaneously identifies with the family and home as “mine.”  Thus, they linger upon the mind more often and attachment to them shackles the mind to material consciousness.  Attachment causes expectations of the kind of behavior we want from family members, and when these expectations are not met, it leads to mental anguish.  Also inevitably, there is separation from the family, either temporarily, if they go to another place, or permanently, if they die.  All these experiences and their apprehensions begin to weigh heavily upon the mind and drag it away from God.  Hence, if we seek immortal bliss, we must practice prudence while interacting with the spouse, child, and home, to prevent the mind from becoming entangled.  We must do our duty toward them, without attachment, as a nurse does her duty in the hospital, or as a teacher does her duty toward her students in the school.Even-mindedness amidst desired and undesired events in life.Pleasurable and painful events come without invitation, just as the night and the day.  That is life.  To rise above these dualities, we must learn to enhance our spiritual strength through detachment toward the world.  We must develop the ability to remain unperturbed by life’s reversals and also not get carried away with the euphoria of success.Constant and exclusive devotion toward Me.Mere detachment means that the mind is not going in the negative direction.  But life is more than merely preventing the undesirable.  Life is about engaging in the desirable.  The desirable goal of life is to consecrate it at the lotus feet of God.  Therefore, Shree Krishna has highlighted it here.Inclination for solitary places.Unlike worldly people, devotees are not driven by the need for company to overcome feelings of loneliness.  They naturally prefer solitude that enables them to engage their mind in communion with God.  Hence, they are naturally inclined to choosing solitary places, where they are able to more deeply absorb themselves in devotional thoughts.Aversion for mundane society.The sign of a materialistic mind is that it finds pleasure in talks about worldly people and worldly affairs.  One who is cultivating divine consciousness develops a natural distaste for these activities, and thus avoids mundane society.  At the same time, if it is necessary to participate in it for the sake of service to God, the devotee accepts it and develops the strength to remain mentally unaffected by it.Constancy in spiritual knowledge.To theoretically know something is not enough.  One may know that anger is a bad thing but may still give vent to it repeatedly.  We have to learn to practically implement spiritual knowledge in our lives.  This does not happen by hearing profound truths just once.  After hearing them, we must repeatedly contemplate upon them.  Such mulling over the divine truths is the constancy in spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about.Philosophical pursuit of the Absolute Truth.Even animals engage in the bodily activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending.  However, God has especially blessed the human form with the faculty of knowledge.  This is not to enable us to engage in bodily activities in a deluxe way, but for us to contemplate upon the questions: “Who am I?  Why am I here?  What is my goal in life?  How was this world created?  What is my connection with the Creator?  How will I fulfill my purpose in life?”  This philosophic pursuit of the truth sublimates our thinking above the animalistic level and brings us to hear and read about the divine science of God-realization.All the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes described above lead to the growth of wisdom and knowledge.  The opposite of these are vanity, hypocrisy, violence, vengeance, duplicity, disrespect for the Guru, uncleanliness of body and mind, unsteadiness, lack of self-control, longing for sense objects, conceit, entanglement in spouse, children, home, etc.  Such dispositions cripple the development self-knowledge.  Thus, Shree Krishna calls them ignorance and darkness."

intellectual exercise.  Unlike bookish knowledge that can be cultivated without a change in one’s character, the spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about requires purification of the heart.  (Here, heart does not refer to the physical organ.  The inner apparatus of mind and intellect is also sometimes referred to as the heart.)  These five verses describe the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes that purify one’s life and illuminate it with the light of knowledge.Humbleness.  When we become proud of the attributes of our individual field, such as beauty, intellect, talent, strength, etc. we forget that God has given all these attributes to us.  Pride thus results in distancing our consciousness from God.  It is a big obstacle on the path of self-realization since it contaminates the entire field by affecting the qualities of the mind and intellect.Freedom from hypocrisy.The hypocrite develops an artificial external personality.  A person is defective from inside, but creates a facade of virtuosity on the outside.  Unfortunately, the external display of virtues is skin-deep and hollow.Non-violence.The cultivation of knowledge requires respect for all living beings.  This requires the practice of non-violence.  Hence the scriptures state:ātmanaḥ pratikūlāni pareśhāṁ na samācharet“If you dislike a certain behavior from others, do not behave with them in that manner yourself.”Forgiveness.  It is freedom from ill will even toward those who have harmed one.  Actually, harboring ill will harms oneself more than the other.  By practicing forgiveness, a person of discrimination releases the negativities in the mind and purifies it.Simplicity.  It is straightforwardness in thought, speech, and action.  Straightforwardness in thought includes absence of deceit, envy, crookedness, etc.  Straightforwardness in speech includes absence of taunt, censure, gossip, ornamentation, etc.  Straightforwardness in action includes plainness in living, forthrightness in behavior, etc.Service of the Guru.Spiritual knowledge is received from the Guru.  This imparting of divine knowledge requires the disciple to have an attitude of dedication and devotion toward the Guru.  By serving the Guru, the disciple develops humbleness and commitment that enables the Guru to impart knowledge.  Thus, Shree Krishna explained to Arjun in verse 4.34:  “Learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.  Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him.  Such an enlightened saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.”Cleanliness of body and mind.Purity should be both internal and external.  The Śhāṇdilya Upaniṣhad states:śhauchaṁ nāma dwividhaṁ-bāhyamāntaraṁ cheti(1.1)“There are two types of cleanliness—internal and external.”  External cleanliness is helpful in maintaining good health, developing discipline, and uncluttering the mind.  But mental cleanliness is even more important, and it is achieved by focusing the mind on the all-pure God.  Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:māyādhīn malīn mana, hai anādi kālīn,hari virahānala dhoya jala, karu nirmala bani dīn.(Bhakti Śhatak verse 79)“The material mind is dirty since endless lifetimes.  Purify it in the fire of longing for God, while practicing utmost humility.”Steadfastness.  Self-knowledge and God-realization are not goals that are attainable in a day.  Steadfastness is the persistence to remain on the path until the goal is reached.  The scriptures state:charaivaite charaivate, charan vai madhu vindati“Keep moving forward.  Keep moving forward.  Those who do not give up will get the honey at the end.”Self-control.It is the restraint of the mind and the senses from running after mundane pleasures that dirty the mind and intellect.  Self-control prevents the dissipation of the personality through indulgence.Dispassion toward the objects of the senses.It is a stage higher than the self-control

made Him renounce worldly existence.  Since we do not have such decisive intellects, we must repeatedly contemplate on these facts to allow the unattractiveness of the world to sink in.Non-attachment.It means dispassion toward the world.  We have only one mind and if we wish to engage it in pursuing spiritual goals, we have to detach it from material objects and persons.  Thesādhakreplaces worldly attachment with love and attachment toward God.Absence of clinging to spouse, children, home, and so on.These are areas where the mind easily becomes attached.  In bodily thinking, one spontaneously identifies with the family and home as “mine.”  Thus, they linger upon the mind more often and attachment to them shackles the mind to material consciousness.  Attachment causes expectations of the kind of behavior we want from family members, and when these expectations are not met, it leads to mental anguish.  Also inevitably, there is separation from the family, either temporarily, if they go to another place, or permanently, if they die.  All these experiences and their apprehensions begin to weigh heavily upon the mind and drag it away from God.  Hence, if we seek immortal bliss, we must practice prudence while interacting with the spouse, child, and home, to prevent the mind from becoming entangled.  We must do our duty toward them, without attachment, as a nurse does her duty in the hospital, or as a teacher does her duty toward her students in the school.Even-mindedness amidst desired and undesired events in life.Pleasurable and painful events come without invitation, just as the night and the day.  That is life.  To rise above these dualities, we must learn to enhance our spiritual strength through detachment toward the world.  We must develop the ability to remain unperturbed by life’s reversals and also not get carried away with the euphoria of success.Constant and exclusive devotion toward Me.Mere detachment means that the mind is not going in the negative direction.  But life is more than merely preventing the undesirable.  Life is about engaging in the desirable.  The desirable goal of life is to consecrate it at the lotus feet of God.  Therefore, Shree Krishna has highlighted it here.Inclination for solitary places.Unlike worldly people, devotees are not driven by the need for company to overcome feelings of loneliness.  They naturally prefer solitude that enables them to engage their mind in communion with God.  Hence, they are naturally inclined to choosing solitary places, where they are able to more deeply absorb themselves in devotional thoughts.Aversion for mundane society.The sign of a materialistic mind is that it finds pleasure in talks about worldly people and worldly affairs.  One who is cultivating divine consciousness develops a natural distaste for these activities, and thus avoids mundane society.  At the same time, if it is necessary to participate in it for the sake of service to God, the devotee accepts it and develops the strength to remain mentally unaffected by it.Constancy in spiritual knowledge.To theoretically know something is not enough.  One may know that anger is a bad thing but may still give vent to it repeatedly.  We have to learn to practically implement spiritual knowledge in our lives.  This does not happen by hearing profound truths just once.  After hearing them, we must repeatedly contemplate upon them.  Such mulling over the divine truths is the constancy in spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about.Philosophical pursuit of the Absolute Truth.Even animals engage in the bodily activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending.  However, God has especially blessed the human form with the faculty of knowledge.  This is not to enable us to engage in bodily activities in a deluxe way, but for us to contemplate upon the questions: “Who am I?  Why am I here?  What is my goal in life?  How was this world created?  What is my connection with the Creator?  How will I fulfill my purpose in life?”  This philosophic pursuit of the truth sublimates our thinking above the animalistic level and brings us to hear and read about the divine science of God-realization.All the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes described above lead to the growth of wisdom and knowledge.  The opposite of these are vanity, hypocrisy, violence, vengeance, duplicity, disrespect for the Guru, uncleanliness of body and mind, unsteadiness, lack of self-control, longing for sense objects, conceit, entanglement in spouse, children, home, etc.  Such dispositions cripple the development self-knowledge.  Thus, Shree Krishna calls them ignorance and darkness."

intellectual exercise.  Unlike bookish knowledge that can be cultivated without a change in one’s character, the spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about requires purification of the heart.  (Here, heart does not refer to the physical organ.  The inner apparatus of mind and intellect is also sometimes referred to as the heart.)  These five verses describe the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes that purify one’s life and illuminate it with the light of knowledge.Humbleness.  When we become proud of the attributes of our individual field, such as beauty, intellect, talent, strength, etc. we forget that God has given all these attributes to us.  Pride thus results in distancing our consciousness from God.  It is a big obstacle on the path of self-realization since it contaminates the entire field by affecting the qualities of the mind and intellect.Freedom from hypocrisy.The hypocrite develops an artificial external personality.  A person is defective from inside, but creates a facade of virtuosity on the outside.  Unfortunately, the external display of virtues is skin-deep and hollow.Non-violence.The cultivation of knowledge requires respect for all living beings.  This requires the practice of non-violence.  Hence the scriptures state:ātmanaḥ pratikūlāni pareśhāṁ na samācharet“If you dislike a certain behavior from others, do not behave with them in that manner yourself.”Forgiveness.  It is freedom from ill will even toward those who have harmed one.  Actually, harboring ill will harms oneself more than the other.  By practicing forgiveness, a person of discrimination releases the negativities in the mind and purifies it.Simplicity.  It is straightforwardness in thought, speech, and action.  Straightforwardness in thought includes absence of deceit, envy, crookedness, etc.  Straightforwardness in speech includes absence of taunt, censure, gossip, ornamentation, etc.  Straightforwardness in action includes plainness in living, forthrightness in behavior, etc.Service of the Guru.Spiritual knowledge is received from the Guru.  This imparting of divine knowledge requires the disciple to have an attitude of dedication and devotion toward the Guru.  By serving the Guru, the disciple develops humbleness and commitment that enables the Guru to impart knowledge.  Thus, Shree Krishna explained to Arjun in verse 4.34:  “Learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.  Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him.  Such an enlightened saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.”Cleanliness of body and mind.Purity should be both internal and external.  The Śhāṇdilya Upaniṣhad states:śhauchaṁ nāma dwividhaṁ-bāhyamāntaraṁ cheti(1.1)“There are two types of cleanliness—internal and external.”  External cleanliness is helpful in maintaining good health, developing discipline, and uncluttering the mind.  But mental cleanliness is even more important, and it is achieved by focusing the mind on the all-pure God.  Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:māyādhīn malīn mana, hai anādi kālīn,hari virahānala dhoya jala, karu nirmala bani dīn.(Bhakti Śhatak verse 79)“The material mind is dirty since endless lifetimes.  Purify it in the fire of longing for God, while practicing utmost humility.”Steadfastness.  Self-knowledge and God-realization are not goals that are attainable in a day.  Steadfastness is the persistence to remain on the path until the goal is reached.  The scriptures state:charaivaite charaivate, charan vai madhu vindati“Keep moving forward.  Keep moving forward.  Those who do not give up will get the honey at the end.”Self-control.It is the restraint of the mind and the senses from running after mundane pleasures that dirty the mind and intellect.  Self-control prevents the dissipation of the personality through indulgence.Dispassion toward the objects of the senses.It is a stage higher than the self-control mentioned above, in which we restrain ourselves by force.  Dispassion means a lack of taste for sense pleasures that are obstacles on the path of God-realization.Absence of egotism.Egotism is the conscious awareness of “I,” “me,” and “mine.”  This is classified as nescience because it is at the bodily level, arising out of the identification of the self with the body.  It is also called theaham chetanā(pride arising out of the sense of self).  All mystics emphatically declare that to invite God into our hearts, we must get rid of the pride of the self.jaba maiṅ thā taba hari nathīṅ, ab hari hai, maiṅ nāhīṅprem galī ati sankarī, yā meṅ dwe na samāhīṅ(Saint Kabir)“When ‘I’ existed, God was not there; now God exists and ‘I’ do not.  The path of divine love is very narrow; it cannot accommodate both ‘I’ and God.”In the path ofjñāna-yogandaṣhṭāṅg-yog, there are elaboratesādhanāsfor getting rid of theaham chetanā.  But in the path ofbhakti-yog, it gets eliminated very simply.  We adddās(servant) in front ofaham(the sense of self), making itdāsoham(I am the servant of God).  Now the “I” no longer remains harmful and self-consciousness is replaced by God-consciousness.Keeping in mind the evils of birth, disease, old-age and death.If the intellect is undecided about what is more important—material enhancement or spiritual wealth—then it becomes difficult to develop the strong will required for acquiring knowledge of the self.  But when the intellect is convinced about the unattractiveness of the world, it becomes firm in its resolve.  To get this firmness, we should constantly contemplate about the miseries that are an inseparable part of life in the material world.  This is what set the Buddha on the spiritual path.  He saw a sick person, and thought, “O there is sickness in the world.  I will also have to fall sick one day.”  Then He saw an old person, and thought, “There is also old age.  This means that I will also become old one day.”  After that, He

deeply absorb themselves in devotional thoughts.Aversion for mundane society.The sign of a materialistic mind is that it finds pleasure in talks about worldly people and worldly affairs.  One who is cultivating divine consciousness develops a natural distaste for these activities, and thus avoids mundane society.  At the same time, if it is necessary to participate in it for the sake of service to God, the devotee accepts it and develops the strength to remain mentally unaffected by it.Constancy in spiritual knowledge.To theoretically know something is not enough.  One may know that anger is a bad thing but may still give vent to it repeatedly.  We have to learn to practically implement spiritual knowledge in our lives.  This does not happen by hearing profound truths just once.  After hearing them, we must repeatedly contemplate upon them.  Such mulling over the divine truths is the constancy in spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about.Philosophical pursuit of the Absolute Truth.Even animals engage in the bodily activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending.  However, God has especially blessed the human form with the faculty of knowledge.  This is not to enable us to engage in bodily activities in a deluxe way, but for us to contemplate upon the questions: “Who am I?  Why am I here?  What is my goal in life?  How was this world created?  What is my connection with the Creator?  How will I fulfill my purpose in life?”  This philosophic pursuit of the truth sublimates our thinking above the animalistic level and brings us to hear and read about the divine science of God-realization.All the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes described above lead to the growth of wisdom and knowledge.  The opposite of these are vanity, hypocrisy, violence, vengeance, duplicity, disrespect for the Guru, uncleanliness of body and mind, unsteadiness, lack of self-control, longing for sense objects, conceit, entanglement in spouse, children, home, etc.  Such dispositions cripple the development self-knowledge.  Thus, Shree Krishna calls them ignorance and darkness."

It is the beginningless Brahman, which lies beyond existence and non-existence.","Day and night are like two sides of the same coin for one cannot exist without the other.  We can only say it is day in some place if night too falls in that place.  But if there is no night, then there is no day either; there is only perpetual light.  Similarly, in the case of Brahman, the word “existence” is not descriptive enough.  Shree Krishna says that Brahman is beyond the relative terms of existence and non-existence.The Brahman, in Its formless and attributeless aspect, is the object of worship of thejñānīs.  In Its personal form, asBhagavān, it is the object of worship of thebhaktas.  Residing within the body, It is known asParamātmā.  All these are three manifestations of the same Supreme Reality.  Later, in verse 14.27, Shree Krishna states:brahmaṇo hi pratiṣhṭhāham“I am the basis of the formless Brahman.” Thus, the formless Brahman and the personal form of God are both two aspects of the Supreme Entity.Both exist everywhere, and hence they both can be called all-pervading.  Referring to These, Shree Krishna reveals the contradictory qualities that manifest in God."

He is unattached to everything, and yet He is the sustainer of all.  Although He is without attributes, yet He is the enjoyer of the three modes of material nature.","Having stated that God’s senses are everywhere, Shree Krishna now states the exact opposite, that He does not possess any senses.  If we try to understand this through mundane logic, we will find this contradictory.  We will inquire, “How can God have both infinite senses and also be without senses?”  However, mundane logic does not apply to Him who is beyond the reach of the intellect.  God possesses infinite contradictory attributes at the same time.  The Brahma Vaivarta Purāṇ states:viruddha dharmo rūposā vaiśhvaryāt puruṣhottamāh“The Supreme Lord is the reservoir of innumerable contradictory attributes.”  In this verse, Shree Krishna mentions a few of the infinite contradictory attributes that exist in the personality of God.He is devoid of mundane senses like ours, and hence it is correct to say that He does not have senses.Sarvendriya vivarjitammeans “He is without material senses.”  However, He possesses divine senses that are everywhere, consequently, it is also correct to say that the senses of God are in all places.Sarvendriya guṇābhāsaṁmeans “He manifests the functions of the senses and grasps the sense objects.”  Including both these attributes, the Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad  states:apāṇipādo javano grahītā, paśhyatyachakṣhuḥ sa śhṛiṇotyakarṇaḥ(3.19)“God does not possess material hands, feet, eyes, and ears.  Yet He grasps, walks, sees, and hears.”Further, Shree Krishna states that He is the sustainer of creation, and yet detached from it.  In His form as Lord Vishnu, God maintains the entire creation.  He sits in the hearts of all living beings, notes their karmas, and gives the results.  Under Lord Vishnu’s dominion, Brahma manipulates the laws of material science to ensure that the universe functions stably.  Also, under Lord Vishnu’s dominion, the celestial gods arrange to provide the air, earth, water, rain, etc. that are necessary for our survival.  Hence, God is the Sustainer of all.  Yet, He is complete in Himself and is, thus, detached from everyone.  The Vedas mention Him asātmārām, meaning “one who rejoices in the self and has no need of anything external.”The material energy is subservient to God, and it works for His pleasure by serving Him.  He is thus the enjoyer of the threeguṇas(modes of material nature).  At the same time, He is alsonirguṇa(beyond the threeguṇas), because theseguṇasare material, while God is divine."

Only My devotees can understand this in reality, and by doing so, they attain My divine nature.","Shree Krishna now concludes His description of the field and the object of knowledge, by mentioning the fruit of knowing this topic.  However, once again, He deems it fit to bring in devotion, and says that only thebhaktas(devotees) can truly understand this knowledge.  Those who practicekarm, jñāna, aṣhṭāṅg,etc. devoid of bhakti cannot truly understand the import of the Bhagavad Gita, even though they themselves may think that they do.  Bhakti is the essential ingredient in all paths leading to knowledge of God.Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj puts this very nicely:jo hari sevā hetu ho, soī karm bakhānajo hari bhagati baṛhāve, soī samujhiya jñāna(Bhakti Śhatak 66)“That work which is done in devotion to God is the realkarm; and that knowledge which increases love for God is real knowledge.”Devotion not only helps us to know God, it also makes the devotee godlike, and hence, Shree Krishna states that the devotees attain His nature.  This has been emphasized in the Vedic scriptures again and again.  The Vedas state:bhaktirevainaṁ nayati bhaktirevainaṁ paśhyati bhaktirevainaṁ darśhayati bhakti vaśhaḥ puruṣho bhaktireva bhūyasī(Māṭhar Śhruti)“Bhakti alone can lead us to God.  Bhakti alone can make us see God.  Bhakti alone can bring us in the presence of God.  God is under the control of bhakti.  Hence, do bhakti exclusively.”  Again the Muṇḍakopaniṣhad states:upāsate puruṣhaṁ ye hyakāmā-ste śhukrametadativartanti dhīrāḥ(3.2.1)“Those who engage in bhakti toward the Supreme Divine Personality, giving up all material desires, escape the cycle of life and death.”  Yet again, the Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states:yasya deve parā bhaktiryathā deve tathā gurautasyaite kathitā hyarthā prakāśhante mahātmanaḥ(6.23)“Those who have unflinching bhakti toward God and identical bhakti toward the Guru, in the hearts of such saintly persons, by the grace of God the imports of the Vedic scriptures are automatically revealed.”  The other Vedic Scriptures also reiterate this emphatically:na sādhayati māṁ yogo na sānkhyaṁ dharma uddhavana svādhyāyas tapas tyāgo yathā bhaktir mamorjitā(Bhagavatam 11.14.20)Shree Krishna states: “Uddhav, I am not attained byaṣhṭāṅg-yog, by the study ofsānkhya, cultivation of scriptural knowledge, austerities, nor by renunciation.  It is by bhakti alone that I am won over.”  In the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna repeatedly states this, in verses 8.22, 11.54, etc.  In verse 18.55, He says:  “Only by loving devotion to Me does one come to know who I am in Truth. Then, having come to know Me, My devotee enters into full consciousness of Me.”  The Ramayan also says:rāmahi kevala premu piārā, jāni leu jo jānanihārā.“The Supreme Lord Ram is only attained through love.  Let this truth be known by all who care to know.”  Actually, this principle is emphasized in the other religious traditions as well.  In the Jewish Torah it is written: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might (Deuteronomy 6.5).  Jesus of Nazareth repeats this commandment in the Christian New Testament as one of the first and foremost commandments to follow (Mark 12.30)The Guru Granth Sahib states:hari sama jaga mahañ vastu nahiṅ, prem panth soñ panthasadguru sama sajjan nahīñ, gītā sama nahiñ grantha“There is no personality like God; there is no path equal to the path of devotion; there is no human equal to the Guru; and there is no scripture that can compare with the Gita.”"

They will be liberated regardless of their present condition.","Ignorance has led the soul into its present predicament.  Having forgotten its spiritual identity as a tiny fragment of God, it has fallen into material consciousness.  Therefore, knowledge is vital for resurrecting itself from its present position.  The Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states exactly the same thing:sanyuktametat kṣharam akṣharaṁ chavyaktāvyaktaṁ bharate viśhwam īśhaḥanīśhaśh chātmā badhyate bhoktṛibhāvā-jjñātvā devaṁ muchyate sarvapāśhaiḥ(1.8)“There are three entities in creation—the ever-changing material nature, the unchangeable souls, and the Master of both, who is the Supreme Lord.  Ignorance of these entities is the cause of bondage of the soul, while knowledge of them helps it cut asunder the fetters of Maya.”The knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about is not just bookish information, but realized wisdom.  Realization of knowledge is achieved when we first acquire theoretical knowledge of the three entities from the Guru and the scriptures, and then engage accordingly in spiritual practice.Shree Krishna now talks about some of these spiritual practices in the next verse."

By such devotion to hearing from saints, they too can gradually cross over the ocean of birth and death.","There are those who are unaware of the methods ofsādhanā.  But somehow, they hear the knowledge through others, and then get drawn to the spiritual path.  In fact, this is usually the case with most people who come to spirituality.  They did not have any formal education in spiritual knowledge, but somehow they got the opportunity to hear or read about it.  Then their interest in devotion to the Lord developed and they began their journey.In the Vedic tradition, hearing from the saints has been highly emphasized as a powerful tool for spiritual elevation.  In the Shreemad Bhagavatam, King Parikshit asked Shukadev the question: “How can we purify the undesirable entities in our hearts, such as lust, anger, greed, envy, hatred, etc.?”  Shukadev replied:śhṛiṇvatāṁ sva-kathāṁ kṛiṣhṇaḥ puṇya-śhravaṇa-kīrtanaḥhṛidy antaḥ stho hy abhadrāṇi vidhunoti suhṛit satām(Bhagavatam 1.2.17)“Parikshit!  Simply hear the descriptions of the divine Names, Forms, Pastimes, Virtues, Abodes, and saints of God from a saint.  This will naturally cleanse the heart of the unwanted dirt of endless lifetimes.”When we hear from the proper source, we develop authentic knowledge of spirituality.  Besides this, the deep faith of the saint from whom we hear begins to flow into us.  Hearing from the saints is the easiest way of building our faith in the spiritual truths.  Further, the enthusiasm of the saint for spiritual activity also brushes onto us.  Enthusiasm for devotion provides the force that enables thesādhakto shrug aside the inertia of material consciousness and cut through the obstacles on the path ofsādhanā.  Enthusiasm and faith in the heart are the foundation stones on which the palace of devotion stands."

Bose established through experiments that even plants, which are non-moving life forms, can feel and respond to emotions.  His experiments proved that soothing music can enhance the growth of plants.  When a hunter shoots a bird sitting on a tree, the vibrations of the tree seem to indicate that it weeps for the bird.  And when a loving gardener enters the garden, the trees feel joyous.  The changes in the vibrations of the tree reveal that it also possesses consciousness and can experience semblances of emotions.  These observations corroborate Shree Krishna’s statement here that all life forms possess consciousness; they are the combination of the eternal soul, which is the source of consciousness, and the body, which is made of the insentient material energy."
