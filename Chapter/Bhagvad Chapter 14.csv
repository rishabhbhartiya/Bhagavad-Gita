He had also elucidated thatprakṛiti(material nature) is responsible for creating the field of activities for thepuruṣh(soul). He added that this does not happen independently, but under the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is also seated within the body of the living being. In this chapter, he goes on to elaborate in detail about the three-fold qualities of material nature (theguṇas). By gaining this knowledge and imbibing it into our consciousness as realized wisdom, we can ascend to the highest perfection."

They will not be reborn at the time of creation nor destroyed at the time of dissolution.,"Shree Krishna assures Arjun that those who equip themselves with the knowledge he is about to bestow will no longer have to accept repeated confinement in a mother’s womb. They will also not be obliged to stay in a state of suspended animation in the womb of God at the time of the universal dissolution, or be reborn along with the next creation. The threeguṇas(modes of material nature) are indeed the cause of bondage, and knowledge of them will illumine the path out of bondage.Shree Krishna repeatedly uses the strategy of proclaiming the results of what he is about to teach, to bring his student to rapt attention. The wordsna vyathantimean “they will not experience misery.” The wordsādharmyammeans they will acquire “a similar divine nature” as God himself. When the soul is released from the bondage of the material energy, it comes under the dominion of God’s divineYogmayaenergy. The divine energy equips it with God’s divine knowledge, love, and bliss. As a result, the soul becomes of the nature of God—it acquires divine godlike qualities."

Also, with the help of the secondary creator Brahma, the material energy creates various life forms, and God casts the souls into appropriate bodies, determined by their past karmas. Thus, Shree Krishna states thatprakṛitiis like the womb and the souls are like the sperms. He places the souls in the womb of Mother Nature to give birth to multitudes of living beings.

These modes bind the eternal soul to the perishable body.","Having explained that all life-forms are born frompuruṣhandprakṛiti, Shree Krishna now explains in the next fourteen verses howprakṛitibinds the soul. Although it is divine, its identification with the body ties it to material nature. The material energy possess threeguṇas—goodness, passion, and ignorance. Hence the body, mind, and intellect that are made fromprakṛitialso possess these three modes.Consider the example of three-color printing. If any one of the colors is released in excess by the machine on the paper, then the picture acquires a hue of that color. Similarly,prakṛitihas the ink of the three colors. Based upon one’s internal thoughts, the external circumstances, pastsanskārs, and other factors, one or the other of these modes becomes dominant for that person. And the mode that predominates creates its corresponding shade upon that person’s personality. Hence, the soul is swayed by the influence of these dominating modes. Shree Krishna now describes the impact of these modes upon the living being."

O sinless one, it binds the soul by creating attachment for a sense of happiness and knowledge.","The wordprakāśhakammeans “illuminating.” The wordanāmayammeans “healthy and full of well-being.” By extension, it also means “of peaceful quality,” devoid of any inherent cause for pain, discomfort, or misery. The mode of goodness is serene and illuminating. Thus,sattva guṇaengenders virtue in one’s personality and illuminates the intellect with knowledge. It makes a person become calm, satisfied, charitable, compassionate, helpful, serene, and tranquil. It also nurtures good health and freedom from sickness. While the mode of goodness creates an effect of serenity and happiness, attachment to them itself binds the soul to material nature.Let us understand this through an example. A traveler was passing through a forest, when three robbers attacked him. The first said, “Let us kill him and steal all his wealth.” The second said, “No, let us not kill him. We will simply bind him, and take away his possessions.” Following the advice of the second robber, they tied him up in ropes and stole his wealth. When they had gone some distance away, the third robber returned. He opened the ropes of the traveler, and took him to the edge of the forest. He showed the way out, and said, “I cannot go out myself, but if you follow this path, you will be able to get out of the forest.”The first robber wastamo guṇa, the mode of ignorance, which literally wants to kill the soul, by degrading it into sloth, languor, and nescience. The second robber wasrajo guṇa, the mode of passion, which excites the passions of the living being, and binds the soul in innumerable worldly desires. The third robber wassattva guṇa, the mode of goodness, which reduces the vices of the living being, eases the material discomfort and puts the soul on the path of virtue. Yet, evensattva guṇais within the realm of material nature. We must not get attached to it; instead, we must use it to step up to the transcendental platform.Beyond these three, isśhuddha sattva, the transcendental mode of goodness. It is the mode of the divine energy of God that is beyond material nature. When the soul becomes God-realized, by his grace, God bestowsśhuddha sattvaupon the soul, making the senses, mind, and intellect divine."

It arises from worldly desires and affections, and binds the soul through attachment to fruitive actions.","Shree Krishna now explains the working ofrajo guṇa, and how it binds the soul to material existence. The Patañjali Yog Darśhan describes material activity as the primary manifestation ofrajo guṇa. Here, Shree Krishna describes its principal manifestation as attachment and desire.The mode of passion fuels the lust for sensual enjoyment. It inflames desires for mental and physical pleasures. It also promotes attachment to worldly things. Persons influenced byrajo guṇaget engrossed in worldly pursuits of status, prestige, career, family, and home. They look on these as sources of pleasure and are motivated to undertake intense activity for the sake of these. In this way, the mode of passion increases desires, and these desires further fuel an increase of the mode of passion. They both nourish each other and trap the soul in worldly life.The way to break out of this is to engage inkarmyog, i.e. to begin offering the results of one’s activities to God. This creates detachment from the world, and pacifies the effect ofrajo guṇa."

It deludes all living beings through negligence, laziness, and sleep.","Tamo guṇais the antithesis ofsattva guṇa. Persons influenced by it get pleasure through sleep, laziness, intoxication, violence, and gambling. They lose their discrimination of what is right and what is wrong, and do not hesitate in resorting to immoral behavior for fulfilling their self-will. Doing their duty becomes burdensome to them and they neglect it, becoming more inclined to sloth and sleep. In this way, the mode of ignorance leads the soul deeper into the darkness of ignorance. It becomes totally oblivious of its spiritual identity, its goal in life, and the opportunity for progress that the human form provides."
8,14,Guṇa Traya Vibhāg Yog,Yog through Understanding the Three Modes of Material Nature,9,सत्त्वं सुखे सञ्जयति रज: कर्मणि भारत |ज्ञानमावृत्य तु तम: प्रमादे सञ्जयत्युत || 9||,sattvaṁ sukhe sañjayati rajaḥ karmaṇi bhāratajñānam āvṛitya tu tamaḥ pramāde sañjayaty uta,"sattvam—mode of goodness;sukhe—to happiness;sañjayati—binds;rajaḥ—mode of passion;karmaṇi—toward actions;bhārata—Arjun, the son of Bharat;jñānam—wisdom;āvṛitya—clouds;tu—but;tamaḥ—mode of ignorance;pramāde—to delusion;sañjayati—binds;uta—indeed",sattvam sukhe sanjayati rajah karmani bharatajnanam avritya tu tamah pramade sanjayaty uta,BG 14.9:Sattvabinds one to material happiness;rajasconditions the soul toward actions; andtamasclouds wisdom and binds one to delusion.,"In the mode of goodness, the miseries of material existence reduce, and worldly desires become subdued. This gives rise to a feeling of contentment with one’s condition. This is a good thing, but it can have a negative side too. For instance, those who experience pain in the world and are disturbed by the desires in their mind feel impelled to look for a solution to their problems, and this impetus sometimes brings them to the spiritual path. However, those in goodness can easily become complacent and feel no urge to progress to the transcendental platform. Also,sattva guṇaillumines the intellect with knowledge. If this is not accompanied by spiritual wisdom, then knowledge results in pride and that pride comes in the way of devotion to God. This is often seen in the case of scientists, academicians, scholars, etc. The mode of goodness usually predominates in them, since they spend their time and energy cultivating knowledge. And yet, the knowledge they possess often makes them proud, and they begin to feel that there can be no truth beyond the grasp of their intellect. Thus, they find it difficult to develop faith toward either the scriptures or the God-realized Saints.In the mode of passion, the souls are impelled toward intense activity. Their attachment to the world and preference for pleasure, prestige, wealth, and bodily comforts, propels them to work hard in the world for achieving these goals, which they consider to be the most important in life.Rajo guṇaincreases the attraction between man and woman, and generateskām(lust). To satiate that lust, man and woman enter into the relationship of marriage and have a home. The upkeep of the home creates the need for wealth, so they begin to work hard for economic development. They engage in intense activity, but each action creates karmas, which further bind them in material existence.The mode of ignorance clouds the intellect of the living being. The desire for happiness now manifests in perverse manners. For example, everyone knows that cigarette smoking is injurious to health. Every cigarette pack carries a warning to that extent issued by the government authorities. Cigarette smokers read this, and yet do not refrain from smoking. This happens because the intellect loses its discriminative power and does not hesitate to inflict self-injury to get the pleasure of smoking. As someone jokingly said, “A cigarette is a pipe with a fire at one end and a fool at the other.” That is the influence oftamo guṇa, which binds the soul in the darkness of ignorance."

Sometimes passion (rajas) dominates goodness (sattva) and ignorance (tamas), and at other times ignorance (tamas) overcomes goodness (sattva) and passion (rajas).","Shree Krishna now explains how the same individual’s temperament oscillates amongst the threeguṇas. These threeguṇasare present in the material energy, and our mind is made from the same energy. Hence, all the threeguṇasare present in our mind as well. They can be compared to three wrestlers competing with each other. Each keeps throwing the others down, and so, sometimes the first is on top, sometimes the second, and sometimes the third. In the same manner, the threeguṇaskeep gaining dominance over the individual’s temperament, which oscillates amongst the three modes. Depending upon the external environment, the internal contemplation, and thesanskārs(tendencies) of past lives, one or the otherguṇabegins to dominate. There is no rule for how long it stays—oneguṇamay dominate the mind and intellect for as short as a moment or for as long as an hour.Ifsattva guṇadominates, one becomes peaceful, content, generous, kind, helpful, serene, and tranquil. Whenrajo guṇagains prominence, one becomes passionate, agitated, ambitious, envious of others success, and develops a gusto for sense pleasures. Whentamo gunabecomes prominent, one is overcome by sleep, laziness, hatred, anger, resentment, violence, and doubt.For example, let us suppose you are sitting in your library, engaged in study. There is no worldly disturbance, and your mind has becomesāttvic. After finishing your study, you sit in your living room and switch on the television. Seeing all the images makes your mindrājasic, and increases your hankering for sense pleasures. While you are watching your favorite channel, your family member comes and changes the channel. This disturbance causestamo guṇato increase in your mind, and you are filled with anger. In this way, the mind sways amongst the threeguṇasand adopts their qualities."

When the mode of passion predominates, O Arjun, the symptoms of greed, exertion for worldly gain, restlessness, and craving develop. O Arjun, nescience, inertia, negligence, and delusion—these are the dominant signs of the mode of ignorance.","Shree Krishna once again repeats how the three modes influence one’s thinking.Sattva guṇaleads to the development of virtues and the illumination of knowledge.Rajo guṇaleads to greed, inordinate activity for worldly attainments, and restlessness of the mind.Tamo guṇaresults in delusion of the intellect, laziness, and inclination toward intoxication and violence.In fact, these modes even influence our attitudes toward God and the spiritual path. To give an example, when the mode of goodness becomes prominent in the mind, we may start thinking, “I have received so much grace from my Guru. I should endeavor to progress rapidly in mysādhanā, since the human form is precious and it should not be wasted in mundane pursuits.” When the mode of passion becomes prominent, we may think, “I must surely progress on the spiritual path, but what is the hurry? At present, I have many responsibilities to discharge, and they are more important.” When the mode of ignorance dominates, we could think, “I am not really sure if there is any God or not, for no one has ever seen him. So why waste time insādhanā?” Notice how the same person’s thoughts have oscillated from such heights to the depths of devotion.For the mind to fluctuate due to the threeguṇasis very natural. However, we are not to be dejected by this state of affairs, rather, we should understand why it happens and work to rise above it.Sādhanāmeans to fight with the flow of the threeguṇasin the mind, and force it to maintain the devotional feelings toward God and Guru. If our consciousness remained at the highest consciousness all day, there would be no need forsādhanā. Though the mind’s natural sentiments may be inclined toward the world, yet with the intellect, we have to force it into the spiritual realm.

It also pacifies the desires of the senses for gratification, and creates a concurrent feeling of happiness and contentment. People influenced by it are inclined toward intellectual pursuits and virtuous ideas. Thus, the mode of goodness promotes wise actions.Rajo guṇainflames the senses, and puts the mind out of control, sending it into a spin of ambitious desires. The living being is trapped by it and over-endeavors for wealth and pleasures that are meaningless from the perspective of the soul.Tamo guṇacovers the living being with inertia and nescience. Shrouded in ignorance, a person performs wicked and impious deeds and bears consequent results."

Upon completion of their sojourn in the present life, the souls reach the kind of place that corresponds to theirguṇas. This can be compared to students applying for college admission after completing school. There are many colleges in the country. Those students with good qualifying criteria at the school level gain admission in the best colleges, while those with poor grades and other scores are admitted to the worst ones. Likewise, the Bhāgavatam says:sattve pralīnāḥ svar yānti nara-lokaṁ rajo-layāḥtamo-layās tu nirayaṁ yānti mām eva nirguṇāḥ(11.25.22)[v2]“Those who are insattva guṇareach the higher celestial abodes; those who are inrajo guṇareturn to the earth planet; and those who are intamo guṇago to the nether worlds; while those who are transcendental to the three modes attain Me.”"

All the living entities in the world are under the grip of the threeguṇas, and hence theguṇasare the active agents in all the works being done in the world. But the Supreme Lord is beyond them. Therefore, he is calledtri-guṇātīt(transcendental to the modes of material nature). Similarly, all the attributes of God—his names, forms, virtues, pastimes, abodes, saints—are alsotri-guṇātīt.If we attach our mind to any personality or object within the realm of the threeguṇas, it results in increasing their corresponding color on our mind and intellect. However, if we attach our mind to the divine realm, it transcends theguṇasand becomes divine. Those who understand this principle start loosening their relationship with worldly objects and people, and strengthening it, throughbhakti, with God and the Guru. This enables them to transcend the threeguṇas, and attain the divine nature of God. This is further elaborated in verse 14.26."

Similarly, if we are influenced by the three modes, we are bound to experience their consequences, which are repeated birth within the material realm, disease, old age, and death. These four are the primary miseries of material life. It was by seeing these that the Buddha first realized that the world is a place of misery, and then searched for the way out of misery.The Vedas prescribe a number of codes of conduct, social duties, rituals, and regulations for human beings. These prescribed duties and codes of conduct are together calledkarm dharma, orvarṇāśhramdharma, orśhārīrikdharma. They help elevate us fromtamo guṇaandrajo guṇatosattva guṇa. However, to reachsattva guṇais not enough; it is also a form of bondage. The mode of goodness can be equated to being fettered with chains of gold. Our goal lies even beyond it—to get out of the prison house of material existence.Shree Krishna explains that when we transcend the three modes, then Maya no longer binds the living being. Thus, the soul gets released from the cycle of life and death and attains immortality. Factually, the soul is always immortal. However, its identification with the material body makes it suffer the illusion of birth and death. This illusory experience is against the eternal nature of the soul, which seeks release from it. Hence, the material illusion is naturally discomforting to our inner being and, from within, we all seek the taste of immortality."

They remain neutral to the modes of nature and are not disturbed by them. Knowing it is only theguṇasthat act, they stay established in the self, without wavering.","Shree Krishna now clarifies the traits of those who have transcended the threeguṇas. They are not disturbed when they see theguṇasfunctioning in the world, and their effects manifesting in persons, objects, and situations around them. Illumined persons do not hate ignorance when they see it, nor get implicated in it. Worldly-minded become overly concerned with the condition of the world. They spend their time and energy brooding about the state of things in the world. The enlightened souls also strive for human welfare, but they do so because it is their nature to help others. At the same time, they realize that the world is ultimately in the hands of God. They simply have to do their duty to the best of their ability, and leave the rest in the hands of God. Having come into God’s world, our first duty is how to purify ourselves. Then, with a pure mind, we will naturally do good and beneficial works in the world, without allowing worldly situations to bear too heavily upon us. As Mahatma Gandhi said: “Be the change that you wish to see in the world.”Shree Krishna explains that persons of illumination, who know themselves to be transcendental to the functioning of the modes, are neither miserable nor jubilant when the modes of nature perform their natural functions in the world. In fact, even when they perceive theseguṇasin their mind, they do not feel disturbed. The mind is made from the material energy, and thus contains the three modes of Maya. So it is natural for the mind to be subjected to the influence of theguṇas, and their corresponding thoughts. The problem is that in bodily consciousness we do not see the mind as different from ourselves. And so, when the mind presents a disturbing thought, we feel, “Oh! I am thinking in this negative manner.” We begin to associate with the poisonous thoughts, allowing them to reside in us and damage us spiritually. To the extent that even if the mind presents a thought against God and Guru, we accept the thought as ours. If, at that time, we could see the mind as separate from us, we would be able to dissociate ourselves from negative thoughts. We would then reject the thoughts of the mind, “I will have nothing to do with any thought that is not conducive to my devotion.” Persons on the transcendental platform have mastered the art of distancing themselves from all negative thoughts arising in the mind from the flow of theguṇas."

They remain neutral to the modes of nature and are not disturbed by them. Knowing it is only theguṇasthat act, they stay established in the self, without wavering.","Shree Krishna now clarifies the traits of those who have transcended the threeguṇas. They are not disturbed when they see theguṇasfunctioning in the world, and their effects manifesting in persons, objects, and situations around them. Illumined persons do not hate ignorance when they see it, nor get implicated in it. Worldly-minded become overly concerned with the condition of the world. They spend their time and energy brooding about the state of things in the world. The enlightened souls also strive for human welfare, but they do so because it is their nature to help others. At the same time, they realize that the world is ultimately in the hands of God. They simply have to do their duty to the best of their ability, and leave the rest in the hands of God. Having come into God’s world, our first duty is how to purify ourselves. Then, with a pure mind, we will naturally do good and beneficial works in the world, without allowing worldly situations to bear too heavily upon us. As Mahatma Gandhi said: “Be the change that you wish to see in the world.”Shree Krishna explains that persons of illumination, who know themselves to be transcendental to the functioning of the modes, are neither miserable nor jubilant when the modes of nature perform their natural functions in the world. In fact, even when they perceive theseguṇasin their mind, they do not feel disturbed. The mind is made from the material energy, and thus contains the three modes of Maya. So it is natural for the mind to be subjected to the influence of theguṇas, and their corresponding thoughts. The problem is that in bodily consciousness we do not see the mind as different from ourselves. And so, when the mind presents a disturbing thought, we feel, “Oh!

The above verse indicates that mere knowledge of the self and its distinction with the body is not enough. With the help ofbhaktiyog, the mind has to be fixed on the Supreme Lord, Shree Krishna. Then alone will the mind becomenirguṇa(untouched by the three modes), just as Shree Krishna isnirguṇa.Many people are of the view that if the mind is fixed upon the personal form of God, it will not rise to the transcendental platform. Only when it is attached to the formlessBrahman, will the mind become transcendental to the modes of material nature. However, this verse refutes such a view. Although the personal form of God possesses infiniteguṇas(qualities), these are all divine and beyond the modes of material nature. Hence, the personal form of God is alsonirguṇa(beyond the three material modes). Sage Ved Vyas explains how the personal form of God isnirguṇa:yastu nirguṇa ityuktaḥ śhāstreṣhu jagadīśhvaraḥprākṛitairheya sanyuktairguṇairhīnatvamuchyate(Padma Purāṇ)[v3]“Wherever the scriptures refer to God asnirguṇa(without attributes), they mean that he is without material attributes. Nevertheless, his divine personality is not devoid of qualities—he possesses infinite divine attributes.”This verse also reveals the proper object of meditation. Transcendental meditation does not mean to meditate upon nothingness. The entity transcendental to the three modes of material nature is God. And so, only when the object of our meditation is God can it truly be called transcendental meditation."

It was previously stated that the all-powerful God has both aspects to his personality—the formless and the personal form. Here, Shree Krishna reveals that theBrahmanwhich thejñānīsworship is the light from the personal form of God. Padma Purāṇ states:yannakhenduruchirbrahma dhyeyaṁ brahmādibhiḥ suraiḥguṇatrayamatītaṁ taṁ vande vṛindāvaneśhvaram(Patal Khand 77.60)[v4]“The light that emanates from the toe nails of the feet of the Lord of Vrindavan, Shree Krishna, is the transcendentalBrahmanthat thejñānīsand even the celestial gods meditate upon.” Similarly, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said:tāñhāra aṅgera śhuddha kiraṇa-maṇḍalaupaniṣhat kahe tāñre brahma sunirmala(Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Ādi Leela 2.12) [v5]“The effulgence emanating from the divine body of God is described by the Upaniṣhads asBrahman.” Thus, in this verse, Shree Krishna unequivocally confirms that the panacea for the disease of the threeguṇasis to engage in unwavering devotion to the personal form of the Supreme Lord."
