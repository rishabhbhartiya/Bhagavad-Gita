The rules for those who enter the renounced order ofsanyāsstate that they should not perform the ritualistickarm kāṇḍactivities; in fact they should not touch fire at all, not even for the purpose of cooking. And they should subsist on alms instead. However, Shree Krishna states in this verse that merely giving up the sacrificial fire does not make one asanyāsī(renunciant).Who are true yogis, and who are truesanyāsīs? There is much confusion in this regard. People say, “This swamiji isphalāhārī(one who eats only fruits and nothing else), and so he must be an elevated yogi.” “Thisbābājī(renunciant) isdūdhāhārī(subsists on milk alone), and hence he must be an even higher yogi.” “This guruji ispavanāhārī(does not eat, lives only on the breath), and so he must definitely be God-realized.” “This sadhu is anāgā bābā(ascetic who does not wear clothes), and thus he is perfectly renounced.” However, Shree Krishna dismisses all these concepts. He says that such external acts of asceticism do not make anyone either asanyāsīor a yogi. Those who can renounce the fruits of their actions, by offering them to God, are the true renunciants and yogis.Nowadays Yoga has become the buzz word in the western world. Numerous Yoga studios have sprung up in every town of every country of the world. Statistics reveal that one out of every ten persons in America is practicing Yoga. But this word “Yoga” does not exist in the Sanskrit scriptures. The actual word is “Yog,” which means “union.” It refers to the union of the individual consciousness with the divine consciousness. In other words, a yogi is one whose mind is fully absorbed in God. It also follows that such a yogi’s mind is naturally detached from the world. Hence, the true yogi is also the truesanyāsī.Persons who performkarm yogdo all activities in the spirit of humble service to God without any desire whatsoever for rewards. Even though they may begṛihasthas(living with a family), such persons are true yogis and the real renunciants."

But mere renunciation is not the goal, nor is it sufficient to reach the goal. Renunciation means that our running in the wrong direction has stopped. We were searching for happiness in the world, and we understood that there is no happiness in material pleasures, so we stopped running toward the world. But, the destination is not reached just by stopping. The destination of the soul is God-realization. The process of going toward God—taking the mind toward him—is the path of Yog. Those who have incomplete knowledge of the goal of life, look upon renunciation as the highest goal of spirituality. Those who truly understand the goal of life, regard God-realization as the ultimate goal of their spiritual endeavor.In the purport to verse 5.4, it was explained that there are two kinds of renunciation—phalgu vairāgyaandyukt vairāgya.Phalgu vairāgyais that where worldly objects are seen as objects of Maya, the material energy, and hence renounced because they are detrimental to spiritual progress.Yukt vairāgyais that where everything is seen as belonging to God, and hence meant to be utilized in his service. In the first kind of renunciation, one would say, “Give up money. Do not touch it. It is a form of Maya, and it impedes the path of spirituality.” In the second kind of renunciation, one would say, “Money is also a form of the energy of God. Do not waste it or throw it away; utilize whatever you have in your possession for the service of God.”Phalgu vairāgyais unstable, and can easily revert to attachment for the world. The name“Phalgu”comes from a river in the city of Gaya, in the state of Bihar in India. The riverPhalguruns below the surface. From atop, it seems as if there is no water, but if you dig a few feet, you encounter the stream below. Similarly, many persons renounce the world to go and live in monasteries, only to find that in a few years the renunciation has vanished and the mind is again attached to the world. Their detachment wasphalgu vairāgya. Finding the world to be troublesome and miserable, they desired to get away from it by taking shelter in monastery. But when they found spiritual life also to be difficult and arduous, they got detached from spirituality as well. Then there are others who establish their loving relationship with God. Motivated by the desire to serve him, they renounce the world to live in a monastery. Their renunciation isyukt vairāgya. They usually continue the journey even if they face difficulties.In the first line of this verse, Shree Krishna states that a realsanyāsī(renunciant) is one who is a yogi, i.e. one who is uniting the mind with God in loving service. In the second line, Shree Krishna states that one cannot be a yogi without giving up material desires. If there are material desires in the mind, then it will naturally run toward the world. Since it is the mind that has to be united with God, this is only possible if the mind is free from all material desires. Thus, to be a yogi one has to be asanyāsīfrom within; and one can only be asanyāsīif one is a yogi."
2,6,Dhyān Yog,The Yog of Meditation,3,आरुरुक्षोर्मुनेर्योगं कर्म कारणमुच्यते |योगारूढस्य तस्यैव शम: कारणमुच्यते || 3||,ārurukṣhor muner yogaṁ karma kāraṇam uchyateyogārūḍhasya tasyaiva śhamaḥ kāraṇam uchyate,ārurukṣhoḥ—a beginner;muneḥ—of a sage;yogam—Yog;karma—working without attachment;kāraṇam—the cause;uchyate—is said;yoga ārūḍhasya—of those who are elevated in Yog;tasya—their;eva—certainly;śhamaḥ—meditation;kāraṇam—the cause;uchyate—is said,arurukshor muner yogam karma karanam uchyateyogarudhasya tasyaiva shamah karanam uchyate,"BG 6.3:To the soul who is aspiring for perfection in Yog, work without attachment is said to be the means; to the sage who is already elevated in Yog, tranquility in meditation is said to be the means.","In chapter 3, verse 3, Shree Krishna mentioned that there are two paths for attaining welfare—the path of contemplation and the path of action. Between these, he recommended to Arjun to follow the path of action. Again in chapter 5, verse 2, he declared it to be the better path. Does this mean that we must keep doing work all our life? Anticipating such a question, Shree Krishna sets the limits for it. When we performkarm yog, it leads to the purification of the mind and the ripening of spiritual knowledge. But once the mind has been purified and we advance in Yog, then we can leavekarm yogand take tokarm sanyās.Material activities now serve no purpose and meditation now becomes the means.So the path we must follow filters down to a matter of our eligibility and Shree Krishna explains the criteria of eligibility in this verse. He says that for those who are aspiring for Yog, the path ofkarm yogis more suitable; and those who are elevated in Yog, the path ofkarm sanyāsis more suitable.The word Yog refers to both the goal and the process to reach the goal. When we talk of it as being the goal, we use Yog as meaning “union with God.” And when we talk of it as being the process, we use Yog as meaning the “path” to union with God.In this second context, Yog is like a ladder we climb to reach God. At the lowest rung, the soul is caught in worldliness, with the consciousness absorbed in mundane matter. The ladder of Yog takes the soul from that level to the stage where the consciousness is absorbed in the divine. The various rungs of the ladder have different names, but Yog is a term common to them all.Yog-ārurukṣhuare thosesādhakswho aspire for union with God and have just begun climbing the ladder.Yog-ārūḍhaare those who have become elevated on the ladder.So, how do we understand when one is elevated in the science of Yog? Shree Krishna explains this next."

So an easy criterion of evaluating the state of one’s mind is to check whether it has become free from all material desires. A person will be considered detached from the world when one no longer craves for sense objects nor is inclined to perform any actions for attaining them. Such a person ceases to look for opportunities to create circumstances to enjoy sensual pleasures, eventually extinguishes all thoughts of enjoying sense objects, and also dissolves the memories of previous enjoyments.The mind now no longer gushes into self-centered activities at the urge of the senses. When we achieve this level of mastery over the mind, we will be considered elevated in Yog."
4,6,Dhyān Yog,The Yog of Meditation,5,उद्धरेदात्मनात्मानं नात्मानमवसादयेत् |आत्मैव ह्यात्मनो बन्धुरात्मैव रिपुरात्मन: || 5||,uddhared ātmanātmānaṁ nātmānam avasādayetātmaiva hyātmano bandhur ātmaiva ripur ātmanaḥ,uddharet—elevate;ātmanā—through the mind;ātmānam—the self;na—not;ātmānam—the self;avasādayet—degrade;ātmā—the mind;eva—certainly;hi—indeed;ātmanaḥ—of the self;bandhuḥ—friend;ātmā—the mind;eva—certainly;ripuḥ—enemy;ātmanaḥ—of the self,uddhared atmanatmanam natmanam avasadayetatmaiva hyatmano bandhur atmaiva ripur atmanah,"BG 6.5:Elevate yourself through the power of your mind, and not degrade yourself, for the mind can be the friend and also the enemy of the self.","We are responsible for our own elevation or debasement. Nobody can traverse the path of God-realization for us. Saints and Gurus show us the way, but we have to travel it ourselves. There is a saying in Hindi:ek peḍa do pakṣhī baiṭhe, ek guru ek chelā, apanī karanī guru utare, apanī karanī chelā[v.01]“There are two birds sitting on a tree—one Guru and one disciple. The Guru will descend by his own works, and the disciple will also only be able to climb down by his own karmas.”We have had innumerable lifetimes before this one, and God-realized Saints were always present on Earth. At any period of time, if the world is devoid of such Saints, then the souls of that period cannot become God-realized. How then can they fulfill the purpose of human life, which is God-realization? Thus, God ensures that God-realized Saints are always present in every era, to guide the sincere seekers and inspire humanity. So, in infinite past lifetimes, many times we must have met God-realized Saints and yet we did not become God-realized. This means that the problem was not lack of proper guidance, but either our reticence in accepting it or working according to it. Thus, we must first accept responsibility for our present level of spirituality, or lack thereof. Only then will we gain the confidence that if we have brought ourselves to our present state, we can also elevate ourselves by our efforts.When we suffer reversals on the path of spiritual growth, we tend to complain that others have caused havoc to us, and they are our enemies. However, our biggest enemy is our own mind. It is the saboteur that thwarts our aspirations for perfection. Shree Krishna states that, on the one hand, as the greatest benefactor of the soul, the mind has the potential of giving us the most benefit; on the other hand, as our greatest adversary, it also has the potential for causing the maximum harm. A controlled mind can accomplish many beneficial endeavors, whereas an uncontrolled mind can degrade the consciousness with most ignoble thoughts.In order to be able to use it as a friend, it is important to understand the mind’s nature. Our mind operates at four levels:Mind: When it creates thoughts, we call itmana, or the mind.Intellect: When it analyses and decides, we call itbuddhi, or intellect.Chitta: When it gets attached to an object or person, we call itchitta.Ego: When it identifies with the bodily identifications and becomes proud of things like wealth, status, beauty, and learning, we call itahankār, or ego.These are not four separate entities. They are simply four levels of functioning of the one mind. Hence, we may refer to them all together as the mind, or as the mind-intellect, or as the mind-intellect-ego, or as the mind-intellect-chitta-ego. They all refer to the same thing.The use of the word ego here is different from its connotation in Freudian psychology. Sigmund Freud (1856 – 1939), an Austrian neurologist, proposed the first theory of psychology regarding how the mind works. According to him, the ego is the “real self” that bridges the gap between our untamed desires (Id) and the value system that is learnt during childhood (Superego).Various scriptures describe the mind in one of these four ways for the purpose of explaining the concepts presented there. They are all referring to the same internal apparatus within us, which is together calledantaḥ karaṇ, or the mind. For example:The Pañchadaśhī refers to all four together as the mind, and states that it is the cause of material bondage.In theBhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna repeatedly talks of the mind and the intellect as being two things, and emphasizes the need to surrender both to God.The Yog Darśhan, while analyzing the different elements of nature, talks of three entities: mind, intellect, and ego.Shankaracharya, while explaining the apparatus available to the soul, classifies the mind into four—mind, intellect,chittaand ego.So when Shree Krishna says that we must use the mind to elevate the self, he means we must use the higher mind to elevate the lower mind. In other words, we must use the intellect to control the mind. How this can be done has been explained in detail in verses 2.41 to 2.44 and again in verse 3.43."
5,6,Dhyān Yog,The Yog of Meditation,6,बन्धुरात्मात्मनस्तस्य येनात्मैवात्मना जित: |अनात्मनस्तु शत्रुत्वे वर्ते तात्मैव शत्रुवत् || 6||,bandhur ātmātmanas tasya yenātmaivātmanā jitaḥanātmanas tu śhatrutve vartetātmaiva śhatru-vat,bandhuḥ—friend;ātmā—the mind;ātmanaḥ—for the person;tasya—of him;yena—by whom;ātmā—the mind;eva—certainly;ātmanā—for the person;jitaḥ—conquered;anātmanaḥ—of those with unconquered mind;tu—but;śhatrutve—for an enemy;varteta—remains;ātmā—the mind;eva—as;śhatru-vat—like an enemy,bandhur atmatmanas tasya yenatmaivatmana jitahanatmanas tu shatrutve vartetatmaiva shatru-vat,"BG 6.6:For those who have conquered the mind, it is their friend. For those who have failed to do so, the mind works like an enemy.","We dissipate a large portion of our thought power and energy in combating people whom we perceive as enemies and potentially harmful to us. The Vedic scriptures say the biggest enemies—lust, anger, greed, envy, illusion, etc.—reside in our own mind. These internal enemies are even more pernicious than the outer ones. The external demons may injure us for some time, but the demons sitting within our own mind have the ability to make us live in constant wretchedness. We all know people who had everything favorable in the world, but lived miserable lives because their own mind tormented them incessantly through depression, hatred, tension, anxiety, and stress.The Vedic philosophy lays great emphasis on the ramification of thoughts. Illness is not only caused by viruses and bacteria, but also by the negativities we harbor in the mind. If someone accidentally throws a stone at you, it may hurt for a few minutes, but by the next day, you will probably have forgotten about it. However, if someone says something unpleasant, it may continue to agitate your mind for years. This is the immense power of the thoughts. In the Buddhist scripture, the Dhammapada (1.3), the Buddha also expresses this truth vividly:“I have been insulted! I have been hurt! I have been beaten! I have been robbed! Misery does not cease in those who harbor such thoughts.When we nourish hatred in our mind, our negative thoughts do more damage to us than the object of our hatred. It has been very sagaciously stated: “Resentment is like drinking poison and hoping that the other person dies.” The problem is that most people do not even realize that their own uncontrolled mind is causing them so much harm. Hence, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj advises:mana ko mano shatru usaki sunahu jani kachhu pyare(Sadhan Bhakti Tattva)[v1]“Dear spiritual aspirant, look on your uncontrolled mind as your enemy. Do not come under its sway.”However, the same mind has the potential of becoming our best friend, if we bring it under control of the intellect, through spiritual practice. The more powerful an entity is, the greater is the danger of its misuse, and also the greater is the scope for its utilization. Since the mind is such a powerful machine fitted into our bodies, it can work as a two-edged sword. Thus, those who slide to demoniac levels do so because of their own mind while those who attain sublime heights also do so because of their purified minds. Accordingly, Franklin D. Roosevelt, former President of America, expressed this very nicely: “Men are not prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of their own minds.” In this verse, Shree Krishna enlightens Arjun about the potential harm and benefits our mind can bestow upon us.In the following three verses, Shree Krishna describes the symptoms of one who isyog-aru?ha (advanced in Yog)."

Such yogis remain peaceful and steadfast in their devotion to God.","Shree Krishna explained in verse 2.14 that the contact between the senses and the sense objects gives the mind the experience of heat and cold, joy and sorrow. As long as the mind has not been subdued, a person chases after the sensual perceptions of pleasure and recoils from the perceptions of pain. The yogi who conquers the mind is able to see these fleeting perceptions as the workings of the bodily senses, distinct from the immortal soul, and thus, remain unmoved by them. Such an advanced yogi rises above the dualities of heat and cold, joy and sorrow, etc.There are only two realms in which the mind may dwell—one is the realm of Maya and the other is the realm of God. If the mind rises above the sensual dualities of the world, it can easily get absorbed in God. Thus, Shree Krishna has stated that an advanced yogi’s mind becomes situated insamādhi(deep meditation) upon God."

They see everything—dirt, stones, and gold—as the same.","Jñāna, or knowledge, is the theoretical understanding obtained by listening to the Guru and from the study of the scriptures.Vijñānais the realization of that knowledge as an internal awakening and wisdom from within. The intellect of the advanced yogibecomes illumined by bothjñānaandvijñāna. Equipped with wisdom, the yogi sees all material objects as modifications of the material energy. Such a yogi does not differentiate between objects based on their attractiveness to the self. The enlightened yogi sees all things in their relationship with God. Since the material energy belongs to God, all things are meant for his service.The wordkuṭastharefers to one who distances the mind from the fluctuating perceptions of senses in contact with the material energy, neither seeking pleasurable situations nor avoiding unpleasurable ones.Vijitendriyais one who has subjugated the senses. The wordyuktmeans one who is in constant communion with the Supreme. Such person begins tasting the divine bliss of God, and hence becomes atṛiptātmā, or one fully satisfied by virtue of realized knowledge."

The yogi who is of equal intellect toward friend, companion, and foe, neutral among enemies and relatives, and unbiased between the righteous and sinful, is considered to be distinguished among humans.","It is the nature of the human mind to respond differently to friends and foes. But an elevated yogi’s nature is different. Endowed with realized knowledge of God, the elevated yogi see the whole creation in its unity with God. Thus, they are able to see all living beings with equality of vision. This parity of vision is also of various levels:“All living beings are divine souls, and hence parts of God.” Thus, they are viewed as equal.ātmavat sarva bhūteṣhu yaḥ paśhyati sa paṇḍitaḥ“A true Pundit is one who sees everyone as the soul, and hence similar to oneself.”Higher is the vision: “God is seated in everyone, and hence all are equally respect worthy.”At the highest level, the yogi develops the vision: “Everyone is the form of God.” The Vedic scriptures repeatedly state that the whole world is a veritable form of God:īśhāvāsyam idam sarvaṁ yat kiñcha jagatyāṁ jagat(Īśhopaniṣhad 1)[v2] “The entire universe, with all its living and non-living beings is the manifestation of the Supreme Being, who dwells within it.”puruṣha evedaṁ sarvaṁ(Puruṣh Sūktam)[v3] “God is everywhere in this world, and everything is his energy.” Hence, the highest yogi sees everyone as the manifestation of God. Endowed with this level of vision, Hanuman says:sīyā rāma maya saba jaga jānī(Ramayan)[v4] “I see the face of Sita Ram in everyone.”These categories have been further detailed in the commentary to verse 6.31. Referring to all three of the above categories, Shree Krishna says that the yogi who can maintain an equal vision toward all persons is even more elevated than the yogi mentioned in the previous verse.Having described the state of Yog, starting with the next verse, Shree Krishna describes the practice by which we can achieve that state."

Mastery in any field requires daily practice. An Olympic swimming champion is not one who goes to the local neighborhood swimming pool once a week on Saturday evenings. Only one who practices for several hours every day achieves the mastery required to win the Olympics. Practice is essential for spiritual mastery as well. Shree Krishna now explains the process of accomplishing spiritual mastery by recommending the daily practice of meditation. The first point he mentions is the need for a secluded place. All day long, we are usually surrounded by a worldly environment; these material activities, people, and conversations, all tend to make the mind more worldly. In order to elevate the mind toward God, we need to dedicate some time on a daily basis for secludedsādhanā.The analogy of milk and water can help elucidate this point. If milk is poured into water, it cannot retain its undiluted identity, for water naturally mixes with it. However, if the milk is kept separate from water and converted into yogurt, and then the yogurt is churned to extract butter, the butter becomes immiscible. It can now challenge the water, “I will sit on your head and float; you can do nothing to me because I have become butter now.” Our mind is like the milk and the world is like water. In contact with the world, the mind gets affected by it and becomes worldly. However, an environment of seclusion, which offers minimal contact with the objects of the senses, becomes conducive for elevating the mind and focusing it upon God. Once sufficient attachment for God has been achieved, one can challenge the world, “I will live amidst all the dualities of Maya, but remain untouched by them.”This instruction for seclusion has been repeated by Shree Krishna in verse 18.52:vivikt sevī laghvāśhī“Live in a secluded place; control your diet.” There is a beautiful way of practically applying this instruction without disturbing our professional and social works. In our daily schedule, we can allocate some time forsādhanā, or spiritual practice, where we isolate ourselves in a room that is free from worldly disturbances. Shutting ourselves out from the world, we should dosādhanāto purify the mind and solidify its focus upon God. If we practice in this manner for one to two hours every day, we will reap its benefits all through the day even while engaged in worldly activities. In this manner we will be able to retain the elevated state of consciousness that was gathered during the dailysādhanāin isolation from the world."

Theāsanshould be neither too high nor too low.","Shree Krishna explains in this verse the external practice forsādhanā.Śhuchau deśhemeans a pure or sanctified place. In the initial stages, the external environment does impact the mind. In later stages ofsādhanā, one is able to achieve internal purity even in dirty and unclean places. But for neophytes, clean surroundings help in keeping the mind clean as well. A mat of Kuśh grass provides temperature insulation from the ground, akin to the yoga mats of today. The deer skin atop it deters poisonous pests like snakes and scorpions from approaching while one is absorbed in meditation. If theāsanis too high, there is the risk of falling off; if theāsanis too low, there is danger of disturbance from insects on the ground. Some instructions regarding external seating given in this verse may be somewhat anachronous to modern times, in which case the spirit of the instruction is to be absorbed in the thought of God, while the instructions for the internal practice remain the same."

The sexual desire facilitates the process of procreation in the animal kingdom, and animals indulge in it primarily for that purpose. In most species, there is a particular mating season; animals do not indulge in sexual activity wantonly. Since humans have greater intellects and the freedom to indulge at will, the activity of procreation is converted into a means of licentious enjoyment. However, the Vedic scriptures lay great emphasis on practicing celibacy. Maharshi Patanjali states:brahmacharya pratiṣhṭhāyāṁ vīrya lābhaḥ(Yog Sūtras 2.38)[v9]“The practice of celibacy leads to great enhancement of energy.”Ayurveda, the Indian science of medicine extollsbrahmacharya(the practice of celibacy) for its exceptional health benefits. One of the students of Dhanvantari approached his teacher after finishing his full course of Ayurveda (the ancient Indian science of medicine), and asked: “O Sage, now kindly let me know the secret of health.” Dhanvantari replied: “This seminal energy is verily theātman. The secret of health lies in preservation of this vital force. He who wastes this vital and precious energy cannot have physical, mental, moral, and spiritual development.” According to Ayurveda, forty drops of blood go into making one drop of semen. Those who waste their semen develop unsteady and agitatedprāṇ. They lose their physical and mental energy, and weaken their memory, mind, and intellect. The practice of celibacy leads to a boost of bodily energy, clarity of intellect, gigantic will power, retentive memory, and a keen spiritual intellect. It creates a sparkle in the eyes and a luster on the cheeks.The definition of celibacy is not restricted to mere abstinence from physical indulgence. The Agni Purāṇ states that the eightfold activities related to sex must be controlled: 1) Thinking about it. 2) Talking about it. 3) Joking about it. 4) Envisioning it. 5) Desiring it. 6) Wooing to get someone interested in it. 7) Enticing someone interested in it. 8) Engaging in it. For one to be considered celibate, all these must be shunned. Thus, celibacy not only requires abstinence from sexual intercourse, but also refrainment from masturbation, homosexual acts, and all other sexual practices.Further, Shree Krishna states here that the object of meditation should be God alone.This point is again reiterated in the next verse."

There are Zen techniques, Buddhist techniques, Tantric techniques, Taoist techniques, Vedic techniques, and so on. Each of these has many sub-branches. Amongst the followers of Hinduism itself, there are innumerable techniques being practiced. Which of these should we adopt for our personal practice? Shree Krishna makes this riddle easy to solve. He states that the object of meditation should be God himself and God alone.The aim of meditation is not merely to enhance concentration and focus, but also to purify the mind. Meditating on the breath,chakras, void, flame, etc. is helpful in developing focus. However, the purification of the mind is only possible when we fix it upon an all-pure object, which is God himself. Hence, verse 14.26 states that God is beyond the three modes of material nature, and when one fixes the mind upon him, it too rises above the three modes. Thus, meditating upon theprāṇasmay be called transcendental by its practitioners, but true transcendental meditation is upon God alone.Now what is the way of fixing the mind upon God? We can make all of God’s divine attributes—names, forms, virtues, pastimes, abodes, associates—the objects of meditation. They are all non-different from God and replete with all his energies. Hence, devotees may meditate upon any of these and get the true benefit of meditating upon God. In the variousbhaktitraditions in India, the name of God is made the basis of contemplation. Thus, the Ramayan states:brahma rām teṅ nāmu baṛa, bara dāyaka bara dāni[v10]“God’s name is bigger than God himself, in terms of its utility to the souls.” Taking the name is a very convenient way of remembering God, since it can be taken anywhere and everywhere—while walking, talking, sitting, eating, etc.However, for mostsādhaksthe name by itself is not sufficiently attractive for enchanting the mind. Due tosanskārsof endless lifetimes, the mind is naturally drawn to forms. Using the form of God as the basis, meditation becomes natural and easy. This is calledrūp dhyānmeditation.Once the mind is focused upon the form of God, we can then further enhance it by contemplating upon the virtues of God—his compassion, his beauty, his knowledge, his love, his benevolence, his grace, and so on. One can then advance in meditation by serving God in the mind. We can visualize ourselves offering foodstuffs to him, worshipping him, singing to him, massaging him, fanning him, bathing him, cooking for him, etc. This is calledmānasī sevā(serving God in the mind). In this way, we can meditate upon the names, forms, virtues, pastimes, etc. of God. All these become powerful means of fulfilling Shree Krishna’s instruction to Arjun, in this verse, to keep the mind absorbed in him.At the end of the verse, Shree Krishna gives the ultimate benefits of meditation, which are liberation from Maya and the everlasting beatitude of God-realization."

He states that those who break the rules of bodily maintenance cannot be successful in Yog. Often beginners on the path, with their incomplete wisdom state: “You are the soul and not this body. So simply engage in spiritual activity, forgetting about the maintenance of the body.”However, such a philosophy cannot get one too far. It is true that we are not the body, yet the body is our carrier as long as we live, and we are obliged to take care of it. The Ayurvedic text, Charak Samhitā states:śharīra mādhyaṁ khalu dharma sādhanam[v11] “The body is the vehicle for engaging in religious activity.” If the body becomes unwell, then spiritual pursuits get impeded too. The Ramayan states:tanu binu bhajana veda nahiṅ varanā[v12] “The Vedas do not recommend that we ignore the body, while engaging in spirituality.” In fact, they instruct us to take good care of our body with the help of material science. The Īśhopaniṣhad states:andhaṁ tamaḥ praviśhanti ye ’vidyām upāsatetato bhūya iva te tamo ya u vidyāyām ratāḥ(9)[v13]“Those who cultivate only material science go to hell. But those who cultivate only spiritual science go to an even darker hell.” Material science is necessary for the maintenance of our body, while spiritual science is necessary for the manifestation of the internal divinity within us. We must balance both in our lives to reach the goal of life. Hence,yogāsans,prāṇāyām, and the science of proper diet are an essential part of Vedic knowledge. Each of the four Vedas has its associate Veda for material knowledge. The associate Veda of Atharva Veda is Ayurveda, which is the hoary science of medicine and good health. This demonstrates that the Vedas lay emphasis on the maintenance of physical health. Accordingly, Shree Krishna says that overeating or not eating at all, extreme activity or complete inactivity, etc. are all impediments to Yog. Spiritual practitioners should take good care of their body, by eating fresh nutritious food, doing daily exercise, and getting the right amount of sleep every night."

The opposite of Yog isbhog, which means engagement in sensual pleasures. Indulgence inbhogviolates the natural laws of the body, and results inrog(disease). As stated in the previous verse, if the body becomes diseased, it impedes the practice of Yog. Thus in this verse, Shree Krishna states that by being temperate in bodily activities and practicing Yog, we can become free from the sorrows of the body and mind.The same instruction was repeated two-and-a-half millennium after Shree Krishna by Gautam Buddha, when he recommended the golden middle path between severe asceticism and sensual indulgence. There is a beautiful story regarding this. It is said that before gaining enlightenment, Gautam Buddha once gave up eating and drinking, and sat in meditation. However, after a few days of practicing in this manner, the lack of nourishment made him weak and dizzy, and he found it impossible to steady his mind in meditation. At that time, some village women happened to be passing by. They were carrying water pots on their heads that they had filled from the river nearby, and were singing a song. The words of the song were: “Tighten the strings of thetānpurā(a stringed Indian musical instrument, resembling a guitar). But do not tighten them so much that the strings break.” Their words entered the ears of Gautam Buddha, and he exclaimed, “These illiterate village women are singing such words of wisdom. They contain a message for us humans. We too should tighten our bodies (practice austerities), but not to the extent that the body is destroyed.”Benjamin Franklin (1706 – 1790), a founding father of the United States, is highly regarded as a self-made man. In an effort to grow his character, starting at the age of 20, he maintained a diary in which he tracked his performance related to the 13 activities he wanted to grow in. The first activity was “Temperance: Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.”"

The answer is when the controlledchitta(mind) becomes fixed and focused exclusively on God. It is then simultaneously and automatically weaned away from all cravings of the senses and desires for worldly enjoyment. At that time one can be considered asyukt, or having perfect Yog. At the end of this very chapter, he also states: “Of all yogis, those whose minds are always absorbed in me, and who engage in devotion to me with great faith, them I consider to be the highest of all.” (Verse 6.47)"

In the wind, the flame flickers naturally and is impossible to control. However, in a windless place, the flame becomes as steady as a picture. Similarly, the mind is fickle by nature and very difficult to control. But when the mind of a yogi is in enthralled union with God, it becomes sheltered against the winds of desire. Such a yogi holds the mind steadily under control by the power of devotion."

When the mind is purified, one is able to perceive the self as distinct from the body, mind, and intellect. For example, if there is muddy water in a glass, we cannot see through it. However, if we put alum in the water, the mud settles down and the water becomes clear. Similarly, when the mind is unclean, it obscures perception of the soul and any acquired scriptural knowledge of theātmāis only at the theoretical level. But when the mind becomes pure, the soul is directly perceived through realization."

It stems from the fact that we are tiny parts of God, who is an ocean of bliss. A number of quotations from the Vedic scriptures establishing this were mentioned in verse 5.21. Here are some more quotations expressing the nature of God as having an infinite ocean of bliss:raso vai saḥ rasaṁ hyevāyaṁ labdhvā nandī bhavati(Taittirīya Upaniṣhad 2.7)[v14]“God is bliss himself; the individual soul becomes blissful on attaining him.”ānandamayo ’bhyāsāt(Brahma Sūtra 1.1.12)[v15]“God is the veritable form of bliss.”satya jñānānantānanda mātraika rasa mūrtayaḥ(Bhāgavatam 10.13.54)[v16]“The divine form of God is made of eternity, knowledge, and bliss.”ānanda sindhu madhya tava vāsā, binu jāne kata marasi piyāsā(Ramayan)[v17]“God, who is the ocean of bliss, is seated within you. Without knowing him, how can your thirst for happiness be satiated?”We have been seeking perfect bliss for eons, and everything we do is in search of that bliss. However, from the objects of gratification, the mind and senses perceive only a shadowy reflection of true bliss. This sensual gratification fails to satisfy the longing of the soul within, which yearns for the infinite bliss of God.When the mind is in union with God, the soul experiences the ineffable and sublime bliss beyond the scope of the senses. This state is calledsamādhiin the Vedic scriptures. The Sage Patanjali states:samādhisiddhirīśhvara praṇidhānāt(Patañjali Yog Darśhan 2.45)[v18] “For success insamādhi, surrender to the Supreme Lord.” In the state ofsamādhi, experiencing complete satisfaction and contentment, the soul has nothing left to desire, and thus becomes firmly situated in the Absolute Truth, without deviating from it for even a moment."

Being thus established, one is not shaken even in the midst of the greatest calamity.","In the material realm, no extent of attainment satiates a person totally. A poor person strives hard to become rich, and feels satisfied if he or she is able to become a millionaire. But when that same millionaire looks at a billionaire, discontentment sets in again. The billionaire is also discontented by looking at an even richer person. No matter what happiness we get, when we perceive a higher state of happiness, the feeling of unfulfillment lingers. But happiness achieved from the state of Yog is the infinite bliss of God. Since there is nothing higher than that, on experiencing that infinite bliss, the soul naturally perceives that it has reached its goal.God’s divine bliss is also eternal, and it can never be snatched away from the yogi who has attained it once. Such a God-realized soul, though residing in the material body, remains in the state of divine consciousness. Sometimes, externally, it seems that the Saint is facing tribulations in the form of illness, antagonistic people, and oppressive environment, but internally the Saint retains divine consciousness and continues to relish the bliss of God. Thus, even the biggest difficulty cannot shake such a Saint. Established in union with God, the Saint rises above bodily consciousness and is thus not affected by bodily harm. Accordingly, we hear from the Puranas how Prahlad was put in a pit of snakes, tortured with weapons, placed in the fire, thrown off a cliff, etc. but none of these difficulties could break Prahlad’s devotional union with God."

This Yog should be resolutely practiced with determination free from pessimism.,"The material world is the realm of Maya, and it has been termed by Shree Krishna in verse 8.15 asduḥkhālayam aśhāśhvatam, or temporary and full of misery. Thus, the material energy Maya is compared to darkness. It has put us in the darkness of ignorance and is making us suffer in the world. However, the darkness of Maya naturally gets dispelled when we bring the light of God into our heart. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu states this very beautifully:kṛiṣhṇa sūrya-sama, māyā haya andhakārayāhāñ kṛiṣhṇa, tāhāñ nāhi māyāra adhikāra(Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Madhya Leela, 22.31)[v19]“God is like the light and Maya is like darkness. Just as darkness does not have the power to engulf light, similarly Maya can never overcome God.” Now, the nature of God is divine bliss while the consequence of Maya is misery. Thus, one who attains the divine bliss of God can never be overcome by the misery of Maya again.Thus, the state of Yog implies both 1) attainment of bliss, and 2) freedom from misery. Shree Krishna emphasizes both successively. In the previous verse, the attainment of bliss was highlighted as the result of Yog; in this verse, freedom from misery is being emphasized.In the second line of this verse Shree Krishna states that the stage of perfection has to be reached through determined practice.He then goes on to explain how we must practice meditation."

When we sit for meditation with the resolve to focus our mind upon God, we will find that ever so often it wanders off in worldlysaṅkalpandvikalp. It is thus important to understand the three steps involved in the process of meditation:With the intellect’s power of discrimination we decide that the world is not our goal. Hence, we forcefully remove the mind from the world. This requires effort.Again, with the power of discrimination we understand that God alone is ours, and God-realization is our goal. Hence, we bring the mind to focus upon God. This also requires effort.The mind comes away from God, and wanders back into the world. This does not require effort, it happens automatically.When the third step happens by itself,sādhaksoften become disappointed, “I tried so hard to focus upon God, but the mind went back into the world.” Shree Krishna asks us not to feel disappointed. He says the mind is fickle and we should be prepared that it will wander off in the direction of its infatuation, despite our best efforts to control it. However, when it does wander off, we should once again repeat steps 1 and 2—take the mind away from the world and bring it back to God. Once again, we will experience that step 3 takes place by itself. We should not lose heart, and again repeat steps 1 and 2.We will have to do this repeatedly. Then slowly, the mind’s attachment toward God will start increasing. And simultaneously, its detachment from the world will also increase. As this happens, it will become easier and easier to meditate. But in the beginning, we must be prepared for the battle involved in disciplining the mind."

Earlier, effort was required to focus it upon God, but now it naturally runs to him. At this stage, the elevated meditator sees everything in its connection with God. Sage Narad states:tat prāpya tad evāvalokayati, tad eva śhṛiṇoti,tad eva bhāṣhayati, tad eva chintayati(Nārad Bhakti Darśhan,Sūtra55)[v20]“The consciousness of the devotee whose mind is united in love with God is always absorbed in him. Such a devotee always sees him, hears him, speaks of him, and thinks of him.” When the mind gets absorbed in God in this manner, the soul begins to experience a glimpse of the infinite bliss of God who is seated within.Sādhaksoften ask how they can know that they are progressing. The answer is embedded in this verse. When we find our inner transcendental bliss increasing, we can consider it as a symptom that our mind is coming under control and the consciousness is getting spiritually elevated. Here, Shree Krishna says that when we areśhānta-rajasaṁ(free from passion) andakalmaṣham(sinless), then we will becomebrahma-bhūtam(endowed with God-realization). At that stage, we will experiencesukham uttamam(the highest bliss)."

The easy way to unite the mind with God is to learn to see everything in its connection with him. For example, let us say that someone hurts us. It is the nature of the mind to develop sentiments of resentment, hatred, etc. toward anyone who harms us. However, if we permit that to happen, then our mind comes away from the divine realm, and the devotional union of our mind with God ceases. Instead, if we see the Supreme Lord seated in that person, we will think, “God is testing me through this person. He wants me to increase the virtue of tolerance, and that is why he is inspiring this person to behave badly with me. But I will not permit the incident to disturb me.” Thinking in this way, we will be able to prevent the mind from becoming a victim of negative sentiments.Similarly, the mind separates from God when it gets attached to a friend or relative. Now, if we train the mind to see God in that person, then each time the mind wanders toward him or her, we will think, “Shree Krishna is seated in this person, and thus I am feeling this attraction.” In this manner, the mind will continue to retain its devotional absorption in the Supreme.Sometimes, the mind laments over past incidents. This again separates the mind from the divine realm because lamentation takes the mind into the past and the present contemplation of God and Guru ceases. Now if we see that incident in connection with God, we will think, “The Lord deliberately arranged for me to experience tribulation in the world, so that I may develop detachment. He is so concerned about my welfare that he mercifully arranges for the proper circumstances that are beneficial for my spiritual progress.” By thinking thus, we will be able to protect our devotional focus. Sage Narad states:loka hānau chintā na kāryā niveditātma loka vedatvāt(Nārad Bhakti Darshan,Sūtra61)[v23]“When you suffer a reversal in the world, do not lament or brood over it. See the grace of God in that incident.” Our self-interest lies in somehow or the other keeping the mind in God, and the simple trick to accomplish this is to see God in everything and everyone. That is the practice stage, which slowly leads to the perfection that is mentioned in this verse, where we are never lost to God and he is never lost to us."

He is also seated in everyone’s heart as the Supreme Soul. In verse 18.61, Shree Krishna states: “I dwell in the hearts of all living beings.” Thus, within the body of each living being, there are two personalities—the soul and the Supreme Soul.Those in material consciousness see everyone as the body, and make distinctions on the basis of caste, creed, sex, age, social status, etc.Those in superior consciousness see everyone as the soul. Thus in verse 5.18, Shree Krishna states: “The truly learned, with the eyes of divine knowledge, see with equal vision a Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater.”The elevated yogis in even higher consciousness see God seated as the Supreme Soul in everyone. They also perceive the world, but they are unconcerned about it. They are like the hansas, the swans who can drink the milk and leave out the water from a mixture of milk and water.The most elevated yogis are calledparamahansas. They only see God, and have no perception of the world. This was the level of realization of Shukadev, the son of Ved Vyas, as stated in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam:yaṁ pravrajantam anupetam apeta kṛityaṁdvaipāyano viraha-kātara ājuhāvaputreti tan-mayatayā taravo ’bhinedustaṁ sarva-bhūta-hṛidayaṁ munim ānato ’smi(1.2.2)[v24]When Shukadev entered the renounced order ofsanyās, walking away from home in his childhood itself, he was at such an elevated level that he had no perception of the world. He did not even notice the beautiful women bathing in the nude in a lake, while he happened to pass by there. All that he perceived was God; all that he heard was God; all that he thought was God.In this verse, Shree Krishna is talking about the perfected yogis who are in the third and fourth stages of the above levels of realization."

It appears to me that it is more difficult to control than the wind.","Arjun speaks for us all when he describes the troublesome mind. It is restless because it keeps flitting in different directions, from subject to subject. It is turbulent because it creates upheavals in one’s consciousness, in the form of hatred, anger, lust, greed, envy, anxiety, fear, attachment, etc. It is strong because it overpowers the intellect with its vigorous currents and destroys the faculty of discrimination. The mind is also obstinate because when it catches a harmful thought, it refuses to let go, and continues to ruminate over it again and again, even to the dismay of the intellect. Thus enumerating its unwholesome characteristics, Arjun declares that the mind is even more difficult to control than the wind. It is a powerful analogy for no one can ever think of controlling the mighty wind in the sky.In this verse, Arjun has addressed the Lord as Krishna. The word “Krishna” means:karṣhati yogināṁ paramahansānāṁ chetānsi iti kṛiṣhṇaḥ[v25] “Krishna is he who forcefully attracts the minds of even the most powerfully-minded yogis andparamahansas.” Arjun is thus indicating that Krishna should also attract his restless, turbulent, strong, and obstinate mind."

But by practice and detachment, it can be controlled.","Shree Krishna responds to Arjun’s comment by calling himMahābāho, which means “Mighty armed one.” He implies, “O Arjun, you defeated the bravest warriors in battle. Can you not defeat the mind?”Shree Krishna does not deny the problem, by saying, “Arjun, what nonsense are you speaking? The mind can be controlled very easily.” Rather, he agrees with Arjun’s statement that the mind is indeed difficult to control. However, so many things are difficult to achieve in the world and yet we remain undaunted and move forward. For example, sailors know that the sea is dangerous and the possibility of terrible storms exists. Yet, they have never found those dangers as sufficient reasons for remaining ashore. Hence, Shree Krishna assures Arjun that the mind can be controlled byvairāgyaandabhyās.Vairāgyameans detachment. We observe that the mind runs toward the objects of its attachment, toward the direction it has been habituated to running in the past. The elimination of attachment eradicates the unnecessary wanderings of the mind.Abhyāsmeans practice, or a concerted and persistent effort to change an old habit or develop a new one. Practice is a very important word forsādhaks. In all fields of human endeavor, practice is the key that opens the door to mastery and excellence. Take, for example, a mundane activity such as typing. The first time people begin typing, they are able to type one word in a minute. But after a year’s typing, their fingers fly on the keyboard at the speed of eighty words a minute. This proficiency comes solely through practice. Similarly, the obstinate and turbulent mind has to be made to rest on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord throughabhyās. Take the mind away from the world—this isvairāgya—and bring the mind to rest on God—this isabhyās. Sage Patanjali gives the same instruction:abhyāsa vairāgyābhyāṁ tannirodhaḥ(Yog Darśhan 1.12)[v26]“The perturbations of the mind can be controlled by constant practice and detachment.”"

However, those who have learnt to control the mind, and who strive earnestly by proper means, can attain perfection in Yog.

He says that those who have not learnt to bridle the mind throughabhyāsandvairāgyafind great difficulty in the practice of Yog. But those who have brought the mind under their control through persistent effort can achieve success by adopting the proper means. The perfect process has already been described by him from verses 6.10 to 6.32. It includes subduing the senses, giving up all desires, focusing the mind upon God alone, thinking of him with an unwavering mind, and seeing everyone with equal vision.This statement creates a doubt in Arjun’s mind regarding the sādhak who is unable to control the mind, and he now questions Shree Krishna in this regard."

Many sincere souls develop faith in the divine knowledge of the scriptures by virtue of the sanskārs of their past lives, or the association of saints, or reversals in the world, etc. There can be many reasons that create the śhraddhā required to begin the journey. However, if these aspirants do not put in the necessary effort and become ayatiḥ (lax), then the mind remains chalit (restless). Such aspirants are unable to complete the journey in this life.

It comes from being a part of God, who is all-perfect, and hence the soul too wishes to be perfect and successful like its source—God. Success can be attained in two realms—material and spiritual. Those who consider the world to be a source of happiness strive for material advancement. And those who consider spiritual wealth to be the real treasure worthy of possessing, strive for it by rejecting material endeavors. However, if such spiritualists fail in their attempt, they are apparently left with neither spiritual nor material assets. Thinking in this manner, Arjun asks whether their position is like that of a broken cloud. A cloud, which breaks away from the group of clouds, becomes worthless. It neither offers sufficient shade, nor does it increase its weight and become rain-bearing. It merely blows in the wind and perishes like a non-entity in the sky. Arjun asks whether the unsuccessful yogi suffers a similar fate, with no position in any sphere."

Scholars of the scriptures possess theoretical knowledge, which is not good enough to dispel doubts, because the scriptures contain many apparent contradictions that can be reconciled only by realization. The God-realized Saints do possess realized knowledge that is limited in extent. They do not become all-knowing. Such realized Saints do possess the power to dispel doubts, but they cannot compete with God, who is all-knowing. God alone issarvajña(omniscient) andsarva-śhaktimān(all-powerful), and hence he is supremely competent in removing all ignorance, just as the sun is competent in repealing the darkness."

The son is affectionately addressed asTāta. The Guru is like a father to his disciple, and hence the Guru too sometimes affectionately addresses the disciple asTāta. Here, by displaying his affection and grace toward Arjun, Shree Krishna wishes to indicate that God takes care of those who tread on his path. They are dear to God because they engage in the most auspicious kind of activity, and “the doer of good never comes to grief.” This verse asserts that God preserves the devotee both in this world and the world hereafter.

Shree Krishna declares thebhakti yogito be the highest, superior to even the bestaṣhṭāṅg yogiandhaṭha yogi. That is becausebhakti, or devotion, is the highest power of God. It is such a power that binds God and makes him a slave of his devotee. Thus, he states in the Bhāgavatam:ahaṁ bhakta-parādhīno hyasvatantra iva dvijasādhubhir grasta-hṛidayo bhaktair bhakta-jana-priyaḥ(9.4.63)[v27]“Although I am supremely independent, yet I become enslaved by my devotees. They conquer my heart. What to speak of my devotees, even the devotees of my devotees are very dear to me.” Thebhakti yogipossesses the power of divine love, and is thus most dear to God and considered by him to be the highest of all.In this verse, Shree Krishna has used the wordbhajate. It comes from the root wordbhaj, which means “to serve.” It is a far more significant word for devotion than “worship,” which means “to adore.” Here, Shree Krishna is talking about those who, not merely adore him, but also serve him with loving devotion. They are thus established in the natural position of the soul as the servant of God, while the other kinds of yogis are still incomplete in their realization. They have connected themselves with God, but they have not yet situated themselves in the understanding that they are his eternal servants.muktānām api siddhānāṁ nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇaḥsu-durlabhaḥ praśhāntātmā koṭiṣhv api mahā-mune(Bhāgavatam 6.14.5)[v28]“Amongst many millions of perfected and liberated saints, the peaceful person who is devoted to the Supreme Lord, Narayan, is very rare.”Another way of understanding this verse is thatbhakti yogprovides the closest and most complete realization of God. This is explained in verse 18.55, where Shree Krishna explains that thebhakti yogialone understands the true personality of God."
